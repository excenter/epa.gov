			<div class="pane-content">
				<p>Molds gradually destroy the things they grow on. By controlling moisture and eliminating mold growth you can:</p>

				<ul><li>Prevent damage to building materials and furnishings</li>
					<li>Save money</li>
					<li>Avoid potential health risks</li>
				</ul></div>
		</div>

		<p>Concern about indoor exposure to mold has been increasing as the public becomes aware that exposure to mold can cause a variety of health effects and symptoms, including allergic reactions. This document presents guidelines for the remediation/cleanup of mold and moisture problems in schools and commercial buildings; these guidelines include measures designed to protect the health of building occupants and remediators. It has been designed primarily for:</p>

		<ul><li>Building managers</li>
			<li>Custodians</li>
			<li>Others who are responsible for commercial building and school maintenance</li>
		</ul><p>It should serve as a reference for potential mold and moisture remediators. Using this document, individuals with little or no experience with mold remediation should be able to make a reasonable judgment as to whether the situation can be handled in-house. It will help those in charge of maintenance to evaluate an in-house remediation plan or a remediation plan submitted by an outside contractor<sup><a href="mold-remediation-schools-and-commercial-buildings-guide.html#IntroMold1">1</a></sup>. Contractors and other professionals who respond to mold and moisture situations in commercial buildings and schools may also want to refer to these guidelines.</p>

		<p><strong>Molds can be found almost anywhere</strong>; they can grow on virtually any organic substance, as long as moisture and oxygen are present. There are molds that can grow on wood, paper, carpet, foods, and insulation. When excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, mold growth will often occur, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or unaddressed. <strong>It is impossible to eliminate all mold and mold spores in the indoor environment. However, mold growth can be controlled indoors by controlling moisture indoors.</strong></p>

		<p>Molds reproduce by making spores that usually cannot be seen without magnification. Mold spores waft through the indoor and outdoor air continually. When mold spores land on a damp spot indoors, they may begin growing and digesting whatever they are growing on in order to survive. Molds gradually destroy the things they grow on.</p>

		<p>Many types of molds exist. <strong>All molds have the potential to cause health effects.</strong> Molds can produce allergens that can trigger allergic reactions or even asthma attacks in people allergic to mold. Others are known to produce potent toxins and/or irritants. Potential health concerns are an important reason to prevent mold growth and to remediate/clean up any existing indoor mold growth.</p>

		<p>Since mold requires water to grow, it is important to prevent moisture problems in buildings. Moisture problems can have many causes, including uncontrolled humidity. Some moisture problems in buildings have been linked to changes in building construction practices during the 1970s, 80s and 90s. Some of these changes have resulted in buildings that are tightly sealed, but may lack adequate ventilation, potentially leading to moisture buildup. Building materials, such as drywall, may not allow moisture to escape easily. Moisture problems may include:</p>

		<ul><li>Roof leaks</li>
			<li>Landscaping or gutters that direct water into or under the building</li>
			<li>Unvented combustion appliances</li>
			<li>Delayed maintenance or insufficient maintenance are also associated with moisture problems in schools and large buildings</li>
		</ul><p>Moisture problems in portable classrooms and other temporary structures have frequently been associated with mold problems. For more information see <a href="../iaq-schools/maintain-portable-classrooms-part-indoor-air-quality-design-tools-schools.html">IAQ Design Tools for Schools - Portable Classrooms</a>.</p>

		<p>When mold growth occurs in buildings, adverse health problems may be reported by some building occupants, particularly those with allergies or respiratory problems. Remediators should avoid exposing themselves and others to mold-laden dusts as they conduct their cleanup activities. Caution should be used to prevent mold and mold spores from being dispersed throughout the air where they can be inhaled by building occupants.</p>

		<h2>Prevention</h2>

		<p>The key to mold control is moisture control. Solve moisture problems before they become mold problems!</p>

		<h3>Mold Prevention Tips</h3>

		<ul><li>Fix leaky plumbing and leaks in the building envelope as soon as possible.</li>
			<br /><li>Watch for condensation and wet spots. Fix source(s) of moisture problem(s) as soon as possible.</li>
			<br /><li>Prevent moisture due to condensation by increasing surface temperature or reducing the moisture level in air (humidity). To increase surface temperature, insulate or increase air circulation. To reduce the moisture level in air, repair leaks, increase ventilation (if outside air is cold and dry), or dehumidify (if outdoor air is warm and humid).</li>
			<br /><li>Keep heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) drip pans clean, flowing properly and unobstructed.</li>
			<br /><li>Vent moisture-generating appliances, such as dryers, to the outside where possible.</li>
			<br /><li>Maintain low indoor humidity, below 60% relative humidity (RH), ideally 30-50%, if possible.</li>
			<br /><li>Perform regular building/HVAC inspections and maintenance as scheduled.</li>
			<br /><li>Clean and dry wet or damp spots within 48 hours.</li>
			<br /><li>Don't let foundations stay wet. Provide drainage and slope the ground away from the foundation.</li>

		</div>

		<p>Assess the size of the mold and/or moisture problem and the type of damaged materials before planning the remediation work. Select a remediation manager for medium or large jobs (or small jobs requiring more than one person). The remediation plan should include steps to fix the water or moisture problem, or the problem may reoccur. The plan should cover the use of appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and include steps to carefully contain and remove moldy building materials to avoid spreading the mold.<sup><a href="mold-remediation-schools-and-commercial-buildings-guide.html#f-2">(2)</a></sup> A remediation plan may vary greatly depending on the size and complexity of the job, and may require revision if circumstances change or new facts are discovered.</p>

		<p>The remediation manager's highest priority must be to protect the health and safety of the building occupants and remediators. It is also important to communicate with building occupants when mold problems are identified.<sup><a href="mold-remediation-schools-and-commercial-buildings-guide.html#f-3">(3)</a></sup> In some cases, especially those involving large areas of contamination, the remediation plan may include temporary relocation of some or all of the building occupants.</p>

		<p>The decision to relocate occupants should consider:</p>

		<ul><li>The size and type of the area affected by mold growth</li>
			<li>The type and extent of health effects reported by the occupants</li>
			<li>The potential health risks that could be associated with debris</li>
			<li>The amount of disruption likely to be caused by remediation activities</li>
		</ul><p>If possible, remediation activities should be scheduled during off-hours when building occupants are less likely to be affected.</p>

		<p>Remediators, particularly those with health-related concerns, may wish to check with their doctors or health care professionals before working on mold remediation or investigating potentially moldy areas. If you have any doubts or questions, you should consult a health professional before beginning a remediation project.</p>

			<li>Porous thermal or acoustic liners inside ductwork</li>
			<li>Roof materials above ceiling tiles (due to roof leaks or insufficient insulation)</li>
		</ul><p>Some building materials, such as dry wall with vinyl wallpaper over it or wood paneling, may act as vapor barriers, <sup><a href="mold-remediation-schools-and-commercial-buildings-guide.html#f-5">(5)</a></sup> trapping moisture underneath their surfaces and thereby providing a moist environment where mold can grow. You may suspect hidden mold if a building smells moldy, but you cannot see the source, or if you know there has been water damage and building occupants are reporting health problems. Investigating hidden mold problems may be difficult and will require caution when the investigation involves disturbing potential sites of mold growth—make sure to use personal protective equipment (PPE). For example, removal of wallpaper can lead to a massive release of spores from mold growing on the underside of the paper. If you believe that you may have a hidden mold problem, you may want to consider hiring an experienced professional. If you discover hidden mold, you should revise your remediation plan to account for the total area affected by mold growth.</p>

					<h3>Method 1: Wet Vacuum</h3>

					<p>Wet vacuums are vacuum cleaners designed to collect water. They can be used to remove water from floors, carpets and hard surfaces where water has accumulated. They should not be used to vacuum porous materials, such as gypsum board. They should be used only when materials are still wet — wet vacuums may spread spores if sufficient liquid is not present.

					<h3>Method 2: Damp Wipe</h3>

					<p>Whether dead or alive, mold is allergenic, and some molds may be toxic. Mold can generally be removed from nonporous (hard) surfaces by wiping or scrubbing with water, or water and detergent. It is important to dry these surfaces quickly and thoroughly to discourage further mold growth. Instructions for cleaning surfaces, as listed on product labels, should always be read and followed. Porous materials that are wet and have mold growing on them may have to be discarded. Since molds will infiltrate porous substances and grow on or fill in empty spaces or crevices, the mold can be difficult or impossible to remove completely.</p>

			<h2 class="pane-title">Mold Remediation/Cleanup and Biocides</h2>

			<div class="pane-content">
				<p>The purpose of mold remediation is to remove the mold to prevent human exposure and damage to building materials and furnishings. It is necessary to clean up mold contamination, not just to kill the mold. Dead mold is still allergenic, and some dead molds are potentially toxic. <strong>The use of a biocide, such as chlorine bleach, is not recommended as a routine practice during mold remediation, although there may be instances where professional judgment may indicate its use</strong> (for example, when immune-compromised individuals are present). In most cases, it is not possible or desirable to sterilize an area; a background level of mold spores will remain in the air (roughly equivalent to or lower than the level in outside air). These spores will not grow if the moisture problem in the building has been resolved.</p>

				<p><strong>If you choose to use disinfectants or biocides, always ventilate the area.</strong> Outdoor air may need to be brought in with fans. When using fans, take care not to distribute mold spores throughout an unaffected area. Biocides are toxic to humans, as well as to mold. You should also use appropriate PPE and read and follow label precautions. <strong>Never mix chlorine bleach solution with cleaning solutions or detergents that contain ammonia; toxic fumes could be produced.</strong></p>

				<p>Some biocides are considered pesticides, and some States require that only registered pesticide applicators apply these products in schools. Make sure anyone applying a biocide is properly licensed, if necessary. Fungicides are commonly applied to outdoor plants, soil and grains as a dust or spray — examples include:</p>

					<h3>Respiratory Protection</h3>

					<p>Respirators protect cleanup workers from inhaling airborne mold, mold spores and dust.</p>

					<ul><li>Minimum: When cleaning up a small area affected by mold, you should use an N-95 respirator. This device:
							<ul><li>Covers the nose and mouth</li>
								<li>Will filter out 95% of the particulates in the air</li>
								<li>Is available in most hardware stores</li>

							In situations where a full-face respirator is in use, additional eye protection is not required.</li>
						<li>Limited: Limited PPE includes use of a half-face or full-face air purifying respirator (APR) equipped with a HEPA filter cartridge. These respirators contain both inhalation and exhalation valves that filter the air and ensure that it is free of mold particles. Note that half-face APRs do not provide eye protection. In addition, the HEPA filters do not remove vapors or gases. You should always use respirators approved by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. See <a href="mold-remediation-schools-and-commercial-buildings-guide.html#tab-7">Resources List</a>.</li>
						<li>Full: In situations in which high levels of airborne dust or mold spores are likely or when intense or long-term exposures are expected (e.g., the cleanup of large areas of contamination), a full-face, powered air purifying respirator (PAPR) is recommended. Full-face PAPRs use a blower to force air through a HEPA filter. The HEPA-filtered air is supplied to a mask that covers the entire face or a hood that covers the entire head. The positive pressure within the hood prevents unfiltered air from entering through penetrations or gaps. Individuals must be trained to use their respirators before they begin remediation. The use of these respirators must be in compliance with OSHA regulations.

				</ul></div>
		</div>

		<p>The purpose of containment during remediation activities is to limit release of mold into the air and surroundings, in order to minimize the exposure of remediators and building occupants to mold. Mold and moldy debris should not be allowed to spread to areas in the building beyond the contaminated site.</p>

		<p>The two types of containment recommended in Table 2 are limited and full. The larger the area of moldy material, the greater the possibility of human exposure and the greater the need for containment. In general, the size of the area helps determine the level of containment. However, a heavy growth of mold in a relatively small area could release more spores than a lighter growth of mold in a relatively large area. Choice of containment should be based on professional judgment.<sup><a href="mold-remediation-schools-and-commercial-buildings-guide.html#f-10">(10)</a></sup> The primary object of containment should be to prevent occupant and remediator exposure to mold. See <a class="menu-internal" href="mold-remediation-schools-and-commercial-buildings-guide.html#tab-5">Table 2</a></p>

				<div class="accordion-pane" id="pane-lim1">
					<h3>Limited Containment</h3>

					<p>Limited containment is generally recommended for areas involving between 10 and 100 square feet (ft<sup>2</sup>) of mold contamination. The enclosure around the moldy area should consist of a single layer of 6-mil, fire-retardant polyethylene sheeting. The containment should have a slit entry and covering flap on the outside of the containment area. For small areas, the polyethylene sheeting can be affixed to floors and ceilings with duct tape. For larger areas, a steel or wooden stud frame can be erected and polyethylene sheeting attached to it. To minimize the migration of contaminants to other parts of the building, certain places within the containment area must be sealed with polyethylene sheeting, including:</p>

					<ul><li>All supply and air vents</li>
						<li>Doors</li>
						<li>Chases</li>
						<li>Risers</li>
					</ul><p>Heavy mold growth on ceiling tiles may impact HVAC systems if the space above the ceiling is used as a return air plenum. In this case, containment should be installed from the floor to the ceiling deck, and the filters in the air handling units serving the affected area may have to be replaced once remediation is finished.</p>

					<p>The containment area must be maintained under negative pressure relative to surrounding areas. This will ensure that contaminated air does not flow into adjacent areas. This can be done with a HEPA-filtered fan unit exhausted outside of the building. For small, easily contained areas, an exhaust fan ducted to the outdoors can also be used. The surfaces of all objects removed from the containment area should be remediated/cleaned prior to removal. The remediation guidelines outlined in Table 2 can be implemented when the containment is completely sealed and is under negative pressure relative to the surrounding area. See <a class="menu-internal" href="mold-remediation-schools-and-commercial-buildings-guide.html#tab-5">Table 2</a></p>

						<div class="figcaption" id="photo8">Photo 8: Full containment on large job</div>
					</div>

					<p>Full containment is recommended for the cleanup of mold-contaminated surface areas greater than 100 ft<sup>2</sup> or in any situation in which it appears likely that the occupant space would be further contaminated without full containment. Double layers of polyethylene should be used to create a barrier between the moldy area and other parts of the building. A decontamination chamber or airlock should be constructed for entry into and exit from the remediation area. The entryways to the airlock from the outside and from the airlock to the main containment area should consist of a slit entry with covering flaps on the outside surface of each slit entry. The chamber should be large enough to hold a waste container and allow a person to put on and remove PPE. All contaminated PPE, except respirators, should be placed in a sealed bag while in this chamber. Respirators should be worn until remediators are outside the decontamination chamber. PPE must be worn throughout the final stages of HEPA vacuuming and damp-wiping of the contained area. PPE must also be worn during HEPA vacuum filter changes or cleanup of the HEPA vacuum.</p>

		<hr /><h3 id="Sampling">Sampling</h3>

		<p>Is sampling for mold needed? In most cases, if visible mold growth is present, sampling is unnecessary. You may consider sampling as part of your site evaluation in specific instances, such as:</p>

		<ul><li>Cases where litigation is involved</li>
			<li>The source(s) of the mold contamination is unclear</li>
			<li>Health concerns are a problem</li>
		</ul><p>Surface sampling may also be useful in order to determine if an area has been adequately cleaned or remediated. Sampling should be done only after developing a sampling plan that includes a confirmable theory regarding suspected mold sources and routes of exposure. Figure out what you think is happening and how to prove or disprove it before you sample.</p>

		<p>If you do not have extensive experience and/or are in doubt about sampling, consult an experienced professional. This individual can help you decide if sampling for mold is useful and/or needed, and will be able to carry out any necessary sampling. It is important to remember that the results of sampling may have limited use or application. Sampling may help locate the source of mold contamination, identify some of the mold species present and differentiate between mold and soot or dirt. Pre- and post-remediation sampling may also be useful in determining whether remediation efforts have been effective. After remediation, the types and concentrations of mold in indoor air samples should be similar to what is found in the local outdoor air. Since no EPA or other Federal threshold limits have been set for mold or mold spores, sampling cannot be used to check a building's compliance with Federal mold standards.</p>

		<p>Sampling for mold should be conducted by professionals with specific experience in designing mold sampling protocols, sampling methods and interpretation of results. Sample analysis should follow analytical methods recommended by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA), the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), or other professional guidelines (see Resources List). Types of samples include:</p>

		<ul><li>Air samples</li>
			<li>Surface samples</li>
			<li>Bulk samples (chunks of carpet, insulation, wall board, etc.)</li>
			<li>Water samples from condensate drain pans or cooling towers</li>
		</ul><p>A number of pitfalls may be encountered when inexperienced personnel conduct sampling:</p>

		<ul><li>They may take an inadequate number of samples</li>
			<li>There may be inconsistency in sampling protocols</li>
			<li>The samples may become contaminated</li>
			<li>Outdoor control samples may be omitted</li>
			<li>You may incur costs for unneeded or inappropriate samples</li>
		</ul><p>Budget constraints will often be a consideration when sampling; professional advice may be necessary to determine if it is possible to take sufficient samples to characterize a problem on a given budget. If it is not possible to sample properly, with a sufficient number of samples to answer the question(s) posed, it would be preferable not to sample. Inadequate sample plans may generate misleading, confusing and useless results.</p>

		<p>Keep in mind that air sampling for mold provides information only for the moment in time in which the sampling occurred, much like a snapshot. Air sampling will reveal, when properly done, what was in the air at the moment when the sample was taken. For someone without experience, sampling results will be difficult to interpret. Experience in interpretation of results is essential.</p>

		<h2>Table 2: Mold Remediation Guidelines</h2>

		<p>Table 2 presents remediation guidelines for building materials that have or are likely to have mold growth. The guidelines in Table 2 are designed to protect the health of occupants and cleanup personnel during remediation. These guidelines are based on the area and type of material affected by water damage and/or mold growth. Please note that these are guidelines; some professionals may prefer other cleaning methods.</p>

		<p>If you are considering cleaning your ducts as part of your remediation plan, you should consult EPA's publication entitled, <em>Should You Have the Air Ducts In Your Home Cleaned?</em> If possible, remediation activities should be scheduled during off-hours when building occupants are less likely to be affected. See:</p>

		<ul><li><a href="../indoor-air-quality-iaq/should-you-have-air-ducts-your-home-cleaned.html">Should You Have the Air Ducts In Your Home Cleaned?</a> <sup>(8)</sup></li>
			<li><a class="menu-internal" href="mold-remediation-schools-and-commercial-buildings-guide.html#tab-7">Resources List</a></li>
		</ul><p>Although the level of personal protection suggested in these guidelines is based on the total surface area contaminated and the potential for remediator and/or occupant exposure, professional judgment should always play a part in remediation decisions. These remediation guidelines are based on the size of the affected area to make it easier for remediators to select appropriate techniques, not on the basis of health effects or research showing there is a specific method appropriate at a certain number of square feet. The guidelines have been designed to help construct a remediation plan. The remediation manager will then use professional judgment and experience to adapt the guidelines to particular situations. When in doubt, caution is advised. Consult an experienced mold remediator for more information.</p>

		<p>A more cautious or conservative approach to remediation is indicated in cases in which:</p>

		<ul><li>A particularly toxic mold species has been identified or is suspected</li>
			<li>When extensive hidden mold is expected (such as behind vinyl wallpaper or in the HVAC system)</li>
			<li>When the chances of the mold becoming airborne are estimated to be high</li>
			<li>Sensitive individuals (e.g., those with severe allergies or asthma) are present</li>
		</ul><p>Always make sure to protect remediators and building occupants from exposure to mold.</p>

		<p>Molds live in the soil, on plants and on dead or decaying matter. Outdoors, molds play a key role in the breakdown of leaves, wood and other plant debris. Molds belong to the kingdom Fungi, and unlike plants, they lack chlorophyll and must survive by digesting plant materials, using plant and other organic materials for food. Without molds, our environment would be overwhelmed with large amounts of dead plant matter.</p>

		<p>Molds produce tiny spores to reproduce, just as some plants produce seeds. These mold spores can be found in both indoor and outdoor air, and settled on indoor and outdoor surfaces. When mold spores land on a damp spot, they may begin growing and digesting whatever they are growing on in order to survive. Since molds gradually destroy the things they grow on, you can prevent damage to building materials and furnishings and save money by eliminating mold growth.</p>

		<p>Moisture control is the key to mold control. Molds need both food and water to survive; since molds can digest most things, water is the factor that limits mold growth. Molds will often grow in damp or wet areas indoors. Common sites for indoor mold growth include</p>

		<ul><li>Bathroom tile</li>
			<li>Basement walls</li>
			<li>Areas around windows where moisture condenses</li>
			<li>Near leaky water fountains or sinks</li>
		</ul><p>Common sources or causes of water or moisture problems include:</p>

		<ul><li>Roof leaks</li>
			<li>Deferred maintenance</li>
			<li>Condensation associated with high humidity or cold spots in the building</li>
			<li>Localized flooding due to:
				<ul><li>Plumbing failures or heavy rains</li>
					<li>Slow leaks in plumbing fixtures</li>
					<li>Malfunction or poor design of humidification systems</li>
				</ul></li>
			<li>Uncontrolled humidity can also be a source of moisture leading to mold growth, particularly in hot, humid climates.</li>
		</ul><p class="pagetop"><a href="mold-remediation-schools-and-commercial-buildings-guide.html#main-content">Top of Page</a></p>

		<hr /><h3 id="AppendixBHealth_Effects">Health Effects and Symptoms Associated with Mold Exposure</h3>

		<p>When moisture problems occur and mold growth results, building occupants may begin to report odors and a variety of health problems, such as:</p>

		<ul><li>Headaches</li>
			<li>Breathing difficulties</li>
			<li>Skin irritation</li>
			<li>Allergic reactions</li>
			<li>Aggravation of asthma symptoms</li>
		</ul><p>All of these symptoms could potentially be associated with mold exposure.</p>

		<p>All molds have the potential to cause health effects. Molds produce allergens, irritants, and in some cases, toxins that may cause reactions in humans. The types and severity of symptoms depend, in part, on:</p>

		<ul><li>The types of mold present</li>
			<li>The extent of an individual's exposure</li>
			<li>The ages of the individuals</li>
			<li>Their existing sensitivities or allergies</li>
		</ul><p>Specific reactions to mold growth can include the following:</p>

				<p><a href="mold-remediation-schools-and-commercial-buildings-guide.html#AppendixBAllergic_Reactions">Allergic Reactions</a> (e.g., rhinitis and dermatitis or skin rash); <a href="mold-remediation-schools-and-commercial-buildings-guide.html#AppendixBAsthma">Asthma</a>; <a href="mold-remediation-schools-and-commercial-buildings-guide.html#AppendixBHypersensitivity_Pneumonitis">Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis</a>; Other Immunologic Effects</p>

				<p>Research on mold and health effects is ongoing. This list is not intended to be all-inclusive.</p>

				<p>The health effects listed above are well documented in humans. Evidence for other health effects in humans is less substantial and is primarily based on case reports or occupational studies.</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<h3 id="AppendixBAllergic_Reactions">Allergic Reactions</h3>

		<p>Inhaling or touching mold or mold spores may cause allergic reactions in sensitive individuals. Allergic reactions to mold are common - these reactions can be immediate or delayed. Allergic responses include hay fever-type symptoms, such as:</p>

		<ul><li>Sneezing</li>
			<li>Runny nose</li>
			<li>Red eyes</li>
			<li>Skin rash (dermatitis)</li>
		</ul><p>Mold spores and fragments can produce allergic reactions in sensitive individuals regardless of whether the mold is dead or alive. Repeated or single exposure to mold or mold spores may cause previously non-sensitive individuals to become sensitive. Repeated exposure has the potential to increase sensitivity.</p>

		<h4 id="AppendixBAsthma">Asthma</h4>

		<p>Molds can trigger asthma attacks in persons who are allergic (sensitized) to molds. The irritants produced by molds may also worsen asthma in non-allergic (non-sensitized) people.</p>

		<h4 id="AppendixBHypersensitivity_Pneumonitis">Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis</h4>

		<p>Hypersensitivity pneumonitis may develop following either short-term (acute) or long-term (chronic) exposure to molds. The disease resembles bacterial pneumonia and is uncommon.</p>

		<h4 id="AppendixBIrritant_Effects">Irritant Effects</h4>

		<p>Mold exposure can cause irritation of the eyes, skin, nose, throat, and lungs, and sometimes, it can also create a burning sensation in these areas.</p>

		<h4 id="AppendixBOpportunistic_Infections">Opportunistic Infections</h4>

		<p>People with weakened immune systems (i.e., immune-compromised or immune-suppressed individuals) may be more vulnerable to infections by molds (as well as more vulnerable than healthy persons to mold toxins). <em>Aspergillus fumigatus</em>, for example, has been known to infect the lungs of immune-compromised individuals. These individuals inhale the mold spores which then start growing in their lungs. <em>Trichoderma</em> has also been known to infect immune-compromised children.</p>

		<p>Healthy individuals are usually not vulnerable to opportunistic infections from airborne mold exposure. However, molds can cause common skin diseases, such as athlete's foot, as well as other infections such as yeast infections.</p>

		<hr /><h3 id="AppendixBMold_Toxins">Mold Toxins (Mycotoxins)</h3>

		<div class="box multi related-info right">
			<h2 class="pane-title">Toxic Molds</h2>

			<div class="pane-content">
				<p>Some molds, such as <em>Aspergillus versicolor</em> and <em>Stachybotrys atra (chartarum)</em>, are known to produce potent toxins under certain circumstances. Although some mycotoxins are well known to affect humans and have been shown to be responsible for human health effects, for many mycotoxins, little information is available, and in some cases research is ongoing. For example, some strains of <em>Stachybotrys atra</em> can produce one or more potent toxins. In addition, preliminary reports from an investigation of an outbreak of pulmonary hemorrhage in infants suggested an association between pulmonary hemorrhage and exposure to <em>Stachybotrys chartarum</em>. Review of the evidence of this association at CDC resulted in a published clarification stating that such an association was not established. Research on the possible causes of pulmonary hemorrhage in infants continues. Consult the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for more information on pulmonary hemorrhage in infants. For CDC contact and other information see <a class="menu-internal" href="mold-remediation-schools-and-commercial-buildings-guide.html#tab-7">Resources list</a></p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<p>Molds can produce toxic substances called mycotoxins. Some mycotoxins cling to the surface of mold spores; others may be found within spores. More than 200 mycotoxins have been identified from common molds, and many more remain to be identified. Some of the molds that are known to produce mycotoxins are commonly found in moisture-damaged buildings. Exposure pathways for mycotoxins can include:</p>

		<ul><li>Inhalation</li>
			<li>Ingestion</li>
			<li>Skin contact</li>
		</ul><p>Although some mycotoxins are well known to affect humans and have been shown to be responsible for human health effects, for many mycotoxins, little information is available.</p>

		<p>Aflatoxin B<sub>1</sub> is perhaps the most well known and studied mycotoxin. It can be produced by the molds <em>Aspergillus flavus</em> and <em>Aspergillus parasiticus</em> and is one of the most potent carcinogens known. Ingestion of aflatoxin B<sub>1</sub> can cause liver cancer. There is also some evidence that inhalation of aflatoxin B<sub>1</sub> can cause lung cancer. Aflatoxin B<sub>1</sub> has been found on contaminated grains, peanuts and other human and animal foodstuffs. However, <em>Aspergillus flavus</em> and <em>Aspergillus parasiticus</em> are <em>not</em> commonly found on building materials or in indoor environments.</p>

		<p>Much of the information on the human health effects of inhalation exposure to mycotoxins comes from studies done in the workplace and some case studies or case reports.</p>

		<p><a href="mold-remediation-schools-and-commercial-buildings-guide.html#AppendixBNote">*</a> Many symptoms and human health effects attributed to inhalation of mycotoxins have been reported including:</p>

		<ul><li>Mucous membrane irritation</li>
			<li>Skin rash</li>
			<li>Nausea</li>
			<li>Immune system suppression</li>
			<li>Acute or chronic liver damage</li>
			<li>Acute or chronic central nervous system damage</li>
			<li>Endocrine effects</li>
			<li>Cancer</li>
		</ul><p>More studies are needed to get a clear picture of the health effects related to most mycotoxins. However, it is clearly prudent to avoid exposure to molds and mycotoxins.</p>

		<p>Some molds can produce several toxins, and some molds produce mycotoxins only under certain environmental conditions. The presence of mold in a building does not necessarily mean that mycotoxins are present or that they are present in large quantities.</p>

		<p id="AppendixBNote"><strong>Note:</strong> Information on ingestion exposure, for both humans and animals, is more abundant — wide range of health effects has been reported following ingestion of moldy foods including liver damage, nervous system damage and immunological effects.</p>

		<hr /><h3 id="AppendixBmVOCs">Microbial Volatile Organic Compounds (mVOCs)</h3>

		<p>Some compounds produced by molds are volatile and are released directly into the air. These are known as microbial volatile organic compounds (mVOCs). Because these compounds often have strong and/or unpleasant odors, they can be the source of odors associated with molds. Exposure to mVOCs from molds has been linked to symptoms such as:</p>

		<ul><li>Headaches</li>
			<li>Nasal irritation</li>
			<li>Dizziness</li>
			<li>Fatigue</li>
			<li>Nausea</li>
		</ul><p>Research on MVOCs is still in the early phase.</p>

		<hr /><h3 id="AppendixBGlucans">Glucans or Fungal Cell Wall Components (also known as β-(1-)-D-Glucans)</h3>

		<p>Glucans are small pieces of the cell walls of molds which may cause inflammatory lung and airway reactions. These glucans can affect the immune system when inhaled. Exposure to very high levels of glucans or dust mixtures including glucans may cause a flu-like illness known as Organic Dust Toxic Syndrome (ODTS). This illness has been primarily noted in agricultural and manufacturing settings.</p>

		<p class="pagetop"><a href="mold-remediation-schools-and-commercial-buildings-guide.html#main-content">Top of Page</a></p>

		<hr /><h3 id="AppendixBSpores">Spores</h3>

		<p>Mold spores are microscopic (2-10 <em>u</em> m) and are naturally present in both indoor and outdoor air. Molds reproduce by means of spores. Some molds have spores that are easily disturbed and waft into the air and settle repeatedly with each disturbance. Other molds have sticky spores that will cling to surfaces and are dislodged by brushing against them or by other direct contact. Spores may remain able to grow for years after they are produced. In addition, whether or not the spores are alive, the allergens in and on them may remain allergenic for years.</p>

		<h2>Communicating with Building Occupants (Appendix C)</h2>

		<p>Communication with building occupants is essential for successful mold remediation. Some occupants will naturally be concerned about mold growth in their building and the potential health impacts. Occupants' perceptions of the health risk may rise if they perceive that information is being withheld from them. The status of the building investigation and remediation should be openly communicated including information on any known or suspected health risks.</p>

		<p>Small remediation efforts will usually not require a formal communication process, but do be sure to take individual concerns seriously and use common sense when deciding whether formal communications are required. Individuals managing medium or large remediation efforts should make sure they understand and address the concerns of building occupants and communicate clearly what has to be done as well as possible health concerns.</p>

		<div class="box multi related-info" style="width:75%">
			<h2 class="pane-title">Mold in Schools</h2>

			<div class="pane-content">
				<p>Special communication strategies may be desirable if you are treating a mold problem in a school. Teachers, parents and other locally affected groups should be notified of significant issues as soon as they are identified. Consider holding a special meeting to provide parents with an opportunity to learn about the problem and ask questions of school authorities, particularly if it is necessary/advisable to ensure that the school is vacated during remediation.</p>

				<p>For more information on investigating and remediating molds in schools, refer to:</p>

				<ul><li><a href="../iaq-schools/indoor-air-quality-tools-schools-action-kit.html">EPA's <em>IAQ Tools for Schools</em> Action Kit</a></li>
				</ul><p>Also review the asthma companion piece for the IAQ Tools for Schools kit, entitled:</p>

				<ul><li><a href="../iaq-schools/managing-asthma-school-environment.html">Managing Asthma in the School Environment</a></li>
				</ul></div>
		</div>

		<p>Communication approaches include regular memos and/or meetings with occupants (with time allotted for questions and answers), depending on the scope of the remediation and the level of occupant interest. Tell the occupants about the size of the project, planned activities and remediation timetable. Send or post regular updates on the remediation progress, and send or post a final memo when the project is completed or hold a final meeting.</p>

		<p>Try and resolve issues and occupant concerns as they come up. When building-wide communications are frequent and open, those managing the remediation can direct more time toward resolving the problem and less time to responding to occupant concerns.</p>

		<div class="box multi related-info">
			<h2 class="pane-title">Communicate, When You Remediate</h2>

			<div class="pane-content">
				<ul><li>Establish that the health and safety of building occupants are top priorities.</li>
					<li>Demonstrate that the occupants' concerns are understood and taken seriously.</li>
					<li>Present clearly the current status of the investigation or remediation efforts.</li>
					<li>Identify a person whom building occupants can contact directly to discuss questions and comments about the remediation activities</li>
				</ul></div>
		</div>

		<p>If possible, remediation activities should be scheduled during off-hours when building occupants are less likely to be affected. Communication is important if occupants are relocated during remediation. The decision to relocate occupants should consider:</p>

		<ul><li>The size of the area affected</li>
			<li>The extent and types of health effects exhibited by the occupants</li>
			<li>The potential health risks associated with debris and activities during the remediation project</li>
		</ul><p>When considering the issue of relocation, be sure to inquire about, accommodate and plan for individuals with:</p>

		<ul><li>Asthma</li>
			<li>Allergies</li>
			<li>Compromised immune systems</li>
			<li>Other health-related concerns</li>
		</ul><p>Smooth the relocation process and give occupants an opportunity to participate in resolution of the problem by clearly explaining the disruption of the workplace and work schedules. Notify individuals of relocation efforts in advance, if possible.</p>
