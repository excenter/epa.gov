      <title>October 28 – EPA requests comment, hosts webinars on additional Clean Power Plan information and proposes carbon goals for Indian Country and U.S. Territories</title>
      <link>http://www2.epa.gov/carbon-pollution-standards/how-comment-clean-power-plan-proposed-rule</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>As part of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s extensive outreach since issuing the proposed <a href="http://www2.epa.gov/carbon-pollution-standards">Clean Power Plan</a>, EPA is making additional information and ideas available for public comment in a notice of data availability (NODA). At the same time, EPA is following through on its commitment made in June to propose goals to reduce carbon pollution in areas of Indian Country and U.S. Territories where fossil-fuel power plants are located.</p><p>In issuing today’s NODA, EPA is seeking to ensure that all interested parties are aware of the issues and ideas that have been consistently raised by a diverse group of stakeholders, so that everyone has the opportunity to consider them as they formulate their comments, which are due on Dec. 1, 2014. Notices of data availability are commonly used to present additional information for the public to consider. They do not change a proposal, nor are they a complete summary of the wide variety of ideas that have been raised. They allow EPA to continue seeking ideas and comments on these and many other issues as the agency works toward a final rule that is flexible and empowers states to chart their own, customized path to meet goals for reducing harmful carbon pollution.</p><p>In a separate but related action, EPA is proposing goals for areas of Indian Country and U.S. Territories where fossil fuel-fired power plants are located to reduce their carbon pollution by 2030. Proposed goals for these areas were not included in the June 2014 proposed Clean Power Plan. The supplemental proposal relies on the approach used in the June 2014 Clean Power Plan and is based on new information and data provided through additional outreach to covered facilities and tribal and territorial governments. The proposal outlines a diverse range of options that tribes and territories could use to meet their goals. EPA will hold a public hearing on the supplemental proposal on Nov. 19, 2014 in Phoenix, Ariz. and will accept comment through Dec. 19, 2014.</p><p>Fact sheets and details about the NODA and the supplemental proposal: <a href="http://www.epa.gov/cleanpowerplan">http://www.epa.gov/cleanpowerplan</a></p><p>EPA is hosting webinars about both the <a href="https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/7303652584663466241">NODA</a> and the <a href="https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/4241469820353838081">supplemental proposal</a> on Wednesday, November 5.</p>]]></description>

      <title>Clean Power Plan State Goal Visualizer Now Available</title>
      <link>http://www2.epa.gov/cleanpowerplantoolbox/clean-power-plan-documents-and-resources</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In the proposed Clean Power Plan (CPP), the EPA sets individual pollution-to-power goal rates for states to meet in 2030 by applying four "building blocks." This <a href="http://www2.epa.gov/cleanpowerplantoolbox/clean-power-plan-documents-and-resources">interactive, excel-based tool</a> presents that goal rate calculation for each state in a step-wise and graphical format, using the same steps as described in the proposal and the state goal computation technical support document. It presents data that is already available on the CPP website and in the proposed rule docket, and the calculations are the same as those that are in the state goal computation technical support document and its supporting data files. The Visualizer is available at <a href="http://www2.epa.gov/cleanpowerplantoolbox/clean-power-plan-documents-and-resources">http://www2.epa.gov/cleanpowerplantoolbox/clean-power-plan-documents-and-resources</a>.</p>]]></description>
