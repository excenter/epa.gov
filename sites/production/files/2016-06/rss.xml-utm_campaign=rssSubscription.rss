        <![CDATA[<p>EPA's State and Local Climate and Energy Program is developing a series of <a href="https://www.epa.gov/statelocalclimate/bringing-benefits-energy-efficiency-and-renewable-energy-low-income-communities">case studies and program profiles</a> to help officials in state and local energy, environmental, housing, and social services agencies, non-profits, and utilities understand promising practices and successful models that they can use to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by bringing energy efficiency and renewable energy (EE/RE) to low-income communities.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.epa.gov/statelocalclimate/bringing-benefits-energy-efficiency-and-renewable-energy-low-income-communities#Case Studies and Program Profiles">profiles in this ongoing series</a> highlight effective programs at the state and local levels that have led to the successful adoption of EE/RE in low-income communities. The profiles focus on how these programs have addressed, in a practical manner, the challenges to ensuring low-income households share in the multiple benefits of EE/RE. </p><p>The following program profiles have just been added: </p><ul><li><a href="https://www.epa.gov/statelocalclimate/duke-energy-neighborhood-energy-saver-program">Duke Energy: Neighborhood Energy Saver Program</a></li><li><a href="https://www.epa.gov/statelocalclimate/duluth-flood-recovery-program">Duluth Flood Recovery Program</a></li><li><a href="https://www.epa.gov/statelocalclimate/elevate-energy-energy-efficiency-services-affordable-multifamily-buildings">Elevate Energy: Energy Efficiency Services for Affordable Multifamily Buildings</a></li></ul>]]></description>

        <![CDATA[<p>We are pleased to announce the release of <a href="https://www.epa.gov/statelocalclimate/download-state-inventory-and-projection-tool?&amp;utm_medium=rss">new State Greenhouse Gas Inventory Tool modules</a>! In this update, all modules were updated with activity data from 1990 through 2014, wherever possible. The Projection Tool and the accompanying Energy Consumption Projection Tool have also been updated with projections currently starting at 2015. The Projection tool allows users to create a simple forecast of all emissions through 2030, based on historical emissions from the 1990-2014 timeframe.</p><p>The updated modules are now available through the EPA website at: <a href="https://www.epa.gov/statelocalclimate/download-state-inventory-and-projection-tool?&amp;utm_medium=rss">https://www.epa.gov/statelocalclimate/download-state-inventory-and-projection-tool</a></p>]]></description>
