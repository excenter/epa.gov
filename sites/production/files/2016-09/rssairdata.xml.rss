		<![CDATA[
		<p>The file download page has been refreshed with new data.  Sorry for the delay, but many changes were being made to AQS that we needed to wait on.<br/><br/>

First, 1/2 MDL values have been removed.  Historically, as part of the data reduction process, AQS has replaced reported values that are below the Method Detection Limit (MDL) with 1/2 of the MDL for most pollutants.  This was phased out for some pollutants beginning in 2013.  This year, we completed the phase out for the remaining pollutants.  Approximately 200 million values for 900 parameters had the 1/2 MDL substitution removed.  Because values across all parameters, years, and summary levels were affected by this, all of the files on the page have been regenerated.  (Previously summary values were based on the substituted values, now they are not.)<br/><br/>

Second, the new ozone standard has not been fully implemented in AQS.  Therefore the summary files do not contain information for the new ozone standard.  However the AQI values have been updated.<br/><br/>

Finally, a user reported an error in the 8-hour files.  For files prior to 2008, the summary value excluding regionally concurred events is incorrect.  This is a bug in our underlying database that could not be corrected before the files were generated.  Rather than removing the 8-hour files, we are including them with this caveat.  Other summary values are correct.

		<![CDATA[
		<p>The “Download Data Files” page has been updated.<br/><br/>

The “Download Data Files” page has been updated. All files have been updated to incorporate any new data that was submitted to EPA since the last update (June, 2015). If a file was changed, it will have a new as-of date indicated on the table. The next update is scheduled for early June and will be the first time 2015 data is expected to be complete.<br/><br/>

Two changes were made for this update.  First, we have added files that list information about the sites and monitors in AQS.  Second, the list of substances in the VOC list has been expanded at the request of users, so those files are larger (and all have been updated).<br/><br/>

IMPORTANT – AQS not yet recalculated new values for the latest ozone standard.  All AQIs, exceedance counts, etc. still reflect the previous standard.  Data for the new standard will be included in the June 2016 update.

		<![CDATA[
		<p>The Query Air Data (QAD) “endpoint” has moved.  That means the URL used to access the interface or run queries has changed.  The link on AirData has been changed to go to the new site.<br/><br/>

The new location is <a href="https://aqs.epa.gov/api">https://aqs.epa.gov/api</a>.<br/><br/>

We’re also using this as an opportunity to rebrand the site as the AQS API (Application Programming Interface).  The same functionality exists that used to be in Query Air Data.  In the near future we will be adding new services for additional types of data – we will post notices here as we do.  The documentation has also been updated and includes a RAML (REST API Modeling Language) version for those that would like to use it.<br/><br/>

We will maintain the old URL for the REST services until Friday, October 30th, 2015.  Your current account will work on the new site.

		<description>
		<![CDATA[
		<p>The AirData website was recently updated to connect to the new AQS Data Mart.<br/><br/>

You may notice some changes, including faster query times for many tools.  In particular, please note:<br/>
<ul>
    </li>Annual means (for NO2 and SO2) and max 3-month averages (for Lead) have been added to the Air Quality Statistics Report and the Monitor Values Report, though the new lead statistics are only available for monitors reporting lead as parameter 14129 (TSP local conditions) and 85129 (PM10 local conditions). Lead reported as parameter 12128 (TSP standard conditions) displays only 1st-4th maxes in the Monitor Values Report at this time.</li>
    </li>In the Air Quality Index Report, there is no longer an option to select the whole U.S. At this time, the query takes too long to implement on the website.</li>
    </li>The Ozone Exceedances visualization tool is significantly faster.</li>
</ul>

		<title>Changes to Data Download Files</title>
        <link>http://aqsdr1.epa.gov/aqsweb/aqstmp/airdata/download_files.html</link>

		<![CDATA[
		<p>The Download Files page has been updated with new data and many other changes.<br/><br/>

Please note that we have made several changes to the data files.  These changes include changing the formats of several files.  We understand that this may be a nuisance to existing programs that ingest the data, but all changes were made based on requests from the users over the last year and we are committed to constantly improving our products.<br/><br/>  

To accommodate the changes, all files have been recreated.  That is, not just files that include data that changed since the last update are new, they are all newly generated.<br/><br/>  

The changes are:<br/><br/>

Hourly Data files: Correction to method detection limit  (MDL) values.  It was recently discovered that the MDL value in the hourly data files may have been listed in a unit of measure that does not match the unit of measure listed in the record.  This happened when the sample had an alternate MDL that was reported in units other than the standard units.<br/><br/>

Hourly Data files: Added Method Code column.  In addition to the method name, these files now include the AQS method code (number).<br/><br/>

Daily Data files: Added Method Code column.  In addition to the method name, these files now include the AQS method code (number).<br/><br/>

Annual Summary Data files: Added Completeness Indicator column.  A column indicating whether the data meets the regulatory requirements for completeness for the year has been added.  Different parameters have different completeness requirements and it is not always straight-forward to determine if an annual value is complete.<br/><br/>

Added files for NO, NOx, and NOy.  Many people have requested that our measurements of NO, NOx, and NOy be made available.  They have always been in the annual files, but we have added daily and hourly files of this data.<br/><br/>

Added files for 8-hour averages of ozone and CO.  The form of the NAAQS average for ozone and CO includes an 8-hour average.  We are providing these files as a convenience for users who need this data.

Any new or changed data reported to EPA since the last update (in February 2014) has been updated in the files.  You can use the “as of” date on the file tables to determine if a file has been updated. Also, we’ve added the blanks data. (Blanks are empty cannisters that are measured for speciation quality assurance reasons). We plan to update these files twice a year - in May and November.</p>

		<category><![CDATA[QAD Status]]></category>
		<description>
		<![CDATA[
		<p>Several small parts of the QAD application have broken over the last few months, leading to large problems.  We have fixed the critical problems and the application is working properly again.  We are still working on some of the remaining problems that are not critical.  Here is what has been done and what you might notice:
<ol>
<li>The page should display better.  We will continue to improve the appearance over time.</li>

<li>Drop down menus are operational.  These components have been restored and the page should be fully functional in all browsers.</li>

<li>The synchronous (rawData) query has been turned on again.   We have implemented a workaround to network problems that caused this service to fail.  There is one big change you may notice related to this: in addition to the file being sent to you interactively, you will also get an email with a link to your results.  We have also add a “processing” message to the screen while rawData queries run.</li>

<li>We ceased compressing/zipping any output files.   We may (or may not) resume this in the future.</li>

<li>New accounts are being processed again.  We will start clearing the backlog immediately.</li>
</ol>
That sums it up.  Thanks for you patience!

		<description>
		<![CDATA[
		<p>The problem with the QAD application were due to the architecture of the rawData (synchronous) service.  When this service would fail it would cause all other services to fail.  As a first step in correcting the problem, we have disabled the rawData (synchronous) service.  Please use only the rawDataNotify (asynchronous) service.  If you attempt the rawData service you will get an error.  We expect the rawDataNotify service to be more stable from this point forward.</p>

		<![CDATA[
		<p>As many of you know, on Dec. 14, 2012, US EPA took steps to protect the health of Americans from fine particle pollution by strengthening the annual health National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for fine particles (PM 2.5) to 12.0 micrograms per cubic meter and retaining the 24-hour PM 2.5 standard of 35 micrograms per cubic meter. As part of the December action, EPA also updated the Air Quality Index for PM 2.5. The effective date of the rule was March 18, 2013.
<br><br>
As of March 18, 2013, the AirData system reflects the revised AQI breakpoints for ALL years of data.
<br><br>

The non-overlapping 2nd max is associated with the 8-hour CO standard.  These AirData reports now provide the non-overlapping 2nd max for CO (8-hour). Also, these reports now show annual CO statistics with one decimal place.</p>
