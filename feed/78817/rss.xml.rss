&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;Synopsis&quot; name=&quot;Synopsis&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Synopsis of Program:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) – as part of its People, Prosperity and the Planet (P3) Award Program – is seeking applications proposing to research, develop, and design solutions to real world challenges involving sustainability. The P3 competition highlights the use of scientific principles in creating innovative projects focused on sustainability. The P3 Award Program was developed to foster progress toward sustainability by achieving the mutual goals of improved quality of life, economic prosperity and protection of the planet—people, prosperity, and the planet—the three pillars of sustainability. The EPA offers the P3 competition in order to respond to the technical needs of the world while moving towards the goal of sustainability. Please see the &lt;a href=&quot;/P3&quot;&gt;People, Prosperity and the Planet (P3) Student Design Competition&lt;/a&gt; website for more details about this program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This solicitation provides the opportunity for the submission of applications for projects that may involve human subjects research. Human subjects research supported by the EPA is governed by EPA Regulation 40 CFR Part 26 (Protection of Human Subjects). This includes the Common Rule at subpart A and prohibitions and additional protections for pregnant women and fetuses, nursing women, and children at subparts B, C, and D. Research meeting the regulatory definition of intentional exposure research found in subpart B is prohibited by that subpart in pregnant women, nursing women, and children.  Research meeting the regulatory definition of observational research found in subparts C and D is subject to the additional protections found in those subparts for pregnant women and fetuses (subpart C) and children (subpart D). All applications must include a Human Subjects Research Statement (HSRS, as described in Section IV.C.5.b of this solicitation), and if the project involves human subjects research, it will be subject to an additional level of review prior to funding decisions being made as described in Sections V.C and V.D of this solicitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guidance and training for investigators conducting EPA-funded research involving human subjects may be obtained here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/osa/basic-information-about-human-subjects-research-0&quot;&gt;Basic Information about Human Subjects Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title40/40cfr26_main_02.tpl&quot;&gt;Basic EPA Policy for Protection of Subjects in Human Research Conducted or Supported by EPA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;Award&quot; name=&quot;Award&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Award Information:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Anticipated Type of Award: Grant&lt;br /&gt;
	Estimated Number of Awards: Approximately 25 awards for Phase I; Approximately 7 awards for Phase II.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;Introduction&quot; name=&quot;Introduction&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A. Introduction &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), under the auspices of the Office of Research and Development (ORD), National Center for Environmental Research (NCER), invites submissions to the 14th Annual P3 Awards: A National Student Design Competition for Sustainability Focusing on People, Prosperity and the Planet. P3 focuses on scientific projects and engineering designs that address the three components of sustainability: people, prosperity and the planet. The P3 Program is intended to support science-based projects and designs developed by interdisciplinary student teams that benefit people by improving their quality of life, promoting prosperity by developing local economies, and protecting the planet by conserving resources and minimizing pollution. Additional details about EPA’s sustainability research can be found in EPA’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPDF.cgi?Dockey=P1002X8M.PDF&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sustainability Research Strategy&lt;/em&gt; (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;fileinfo&quot;&gt;(72 pp, 1.14 MB)&lt;/span&gt; (2007) which presents the role of EPA’s Office of Research and Development in improving understanding of the earth’s natural and man-made systems, assessing threats to those systems, and developing and applying new technologies and decision support tools. An overview of the meaning of sustainability for application in NCER research proposals is located here: &lt;a href=&quot;/sites/production/files/2015-05/documents/sustainability_primer_v9.pdf&quot;&gt;Sustainability Primer (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;fileinfo&quot;&gt;(2 pp, 195 K)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of sustainable development became widely promoted following the 1987 publication of &lt;em&gt;Our Common Future &lt;/em&gt;by the World Commission on Environment and Development (World Commission on Environment and Development, 1987).  That document defined sustainability as “meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” Earlier, the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 introduced the concept of sustainability and the definition used there was reiterated in Executive Order 13514 - Federal Leadership in Environmental, Energy, and Economic Performance.  It stated that the goal of sustainability is to, “create and maintain conditions, under which humans and nature can exist in productive harmony, that permit fulfilling the social, economic and other requirements of present and future generations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of sustainable development as encompassing activities that address people, prosperity and the planet continues to have international support as indicated by the United Nations 2012 Conference on Sustainable Development Rio+20 outcome document.  This document states “Eradicating poverty is the greatest global challenge facing the world today and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development;” followed by “We recognize that poverty eradication, changing unsustainable and promoting sustainable patterns of consumption and production and protecting and managing the natural resource base of economic and social development are the overarching objectives of and essential requirements for sustainable development.”  That report went on to state “We therefore acknowledge the need to further mainstream sustainable development at all levels, integrating economic, social and environmental aspects and recognizing their interlinkages, so as to achieve sustainable development in all its dimensions.”  (United Nations, 2012)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an article entitled &lt;em&gt;Sustainability science and engineering: The emergence of a new metadiscipline, &lt;/em&gt;Mihelcic et al. (2003) provided a useful definition of sustainability for scientists and engineers as the “design of human and industrial systems to ensure that humankind’s use of natural resources and cycles do not lead to diminished quality of life due either to losses in future economic opportunities or to adverse impacts on social conditions, human health and the environment.”  Fundamentally, sustainability requires the balancing of economic prosperity, environmental responsibility, and social fairness.  It is imperative to recognize the key role scientific, engineering, and policy innovations can play in addressing the sustainable development challenge. Successful sustainable design recognizes the needs, available resources, and boundaries of the intended user.  See for instance: &lt;em&gt;Cradle to Cradle&lt;/em&gt; (Braungart &amp;amp; McDonough, 2002), &lt;em&gt;The Upcycle:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Beyond Sustainability--Designing for Abundance&lt;/em&gt; (McDonough &amp;amp; Braungart, 2013), &lt;em&gt;Engineering Biomimicry&lt;/em&gt; (Lakhtakia &amp;amp; Martín-Palma, 2013) and &lt;em&gt;Biomimicry&lt;/em&gt; (Benyus, 2002).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The P3 Award Program is composed of two phases that award grants on a competitive basis.  The purpose of this RFA is to solicit proposals for innovative research projects and designs to compete for the first phase of the P3 Award Program. The first phase is a competition for one-year grants of up to $15,000 to test, research, and develop innovative scientific projects or engineering designs that will promote sustainable development. In the spring of 2018, the Phase I grantees awarded from this solicitation are required to present their projects/designs in the Washington D.C. metropolitan area; teams will be informed of the venues as registration and logistics are available.  Teams will also submit a &lt;em&gt;Project Report&lt;/em&gt; that will serve as an application for a Phase II grant award of up to $75,000. The Phase II grant awards are intended to support the further development and demonstration of the sustainability projects/designs created in Phase I.  The competitors for 2018 P3 Phase II grants are limited to recipients of Phase I grant awards from this solicitation.  Additional instructions for completing the Phase II proposals, which will be due approximately seven months after the Phase I grants are awarded, will be distributed to Phase I recipients.  Those projects identified for receipt of a Phase II grant will be recognized as P3 Award recipients on the P3 website.  If a team elects not to compete for a Phase II grant award, its faculty advisor must inform his or her Project Officer and a Final Report must be submitted per the award Terms and Conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This RFA represents the 14th National P3 Awards competition. Previously awarded projects funded through this program can be viewed at the &lt;a href=&quot;/P3&quot;&gt;People, Prosperity and the Planet (P3) Student Design Competition&lt;/a&gt; website. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EPA recognizes that it is important to engage all available minds to address the environmental challenges the nation faces. At the same time, EPA seeks to expand the environmental conversation by including members of communities which may have not previously participated in such dialogues to participate in EPA programs. For this reason, EPA strongly encourages all eligible applicants identified in Section III, including minority serving institutions (MSIs), to apply under this opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For purposes of this solicitation, the following are considered MSIs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Historically Black Colleges and Universities, as defined by the Higher Education Act (20 U.S.C. § 1061). A list of these schools can be found at &lt;a href=&quot;http://sites.ed.gov/whhbcu/one-hundred-and-five-historically-black-colleges-and-universities/&quot;&gt;White House Initiative on Historically Black Colleges and Universities&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Tribal Colleges and Universities, as defined by the Higher Education Act (20 U.S.C. § 1059(c)). A list of these schools can be found at &lt;a href=&quot;http://sites.ed.gov/whiaiane/tribes-tcus/tribal-colleges-and-universities/&quot;&gt;American Indian Tribally Controlled Colleges and Universities&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs), as defined by the Higher Education Act (20 U.S.C. § 1101a(a)(5)). There is no list of HSIs. HSIs are institutions of higher education that, at the time of application submittal, have an enrollment of undergraduate full-time equivalent students that is at least 25% Hispanic students at the end of the award year immediately preceding the date of application for this grant; and&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-Serving Institutions; (AANAPISIs), as defined by the Higher Education Act (20 U.S.C. § 1059g(a)(2)). There is no list of AANAPISIs. AANAPISIs are institutions of higher education that, at the time of application submittal, have an enrollment of undergraduate students that is not less than 10 % students who are Asian American or Native American Pacific Islander.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;Background&quot; name=&quot;Background&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B. Background&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Increased awareness and understanding of sustainability are critical components for promoting a systematic shift towards more environmentally benign and sustainable products, processes, and systems. It is essential that all involved in the design, discovery, demonstration, and implementation of sustainable innovations understand the fundamental techniques and principles that underlie sustainability.  Innovative research can take the form of wholly new applications or applications that build on existing knowledge and approaches for new uses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dt&gt;EPA’s P3 Program has identified the following four strategic program goals.&lt;/dt&gt;
	&lt;dd&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goal 1&lt;/strong&gt;: Engage and educate the next generation of scientists, engineers, and the greater academic and external communities in the principles of sustainability.&lt;/dd&gt;
	&lt;dd&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goal 2&lt;/strong&gt;: Spark innovation and sustainable technologies through research and development conducted by the P3 projects.&lt;/dd&gt;
	&lt;dd&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goal 3&lt;/strong&gt;: Support the demonstration of sustainable technologies around the world.&lt;/dd&gt;
	&lt;dd&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goal 4&lt;/strong&gt;: Foster the development of enterprises rooted in sustainability.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specific outputs and outcomes from the Phase I and II grant awards are described in Section I.D. below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This announcement addresses the first phase (Phase I) of the P3 competition by requesting proposals for innovative research projects or designs from eligible institutions.  The Phase I grants are intended to support an interdisciplinary team of undergraduate and/or graduate students to develop their projects/designs in preparation for competing for a P3 Phase II grant award to demonstrate their proposed projects/designs. The EPA will fund approximately 25 Phase I research proposals from around the country during the 2017-2018 academic years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposal process for the Phase II grant awards will begin in the spring of 2018, when the student teams and their faculty advisor (the Principal Investigator [PI] on the grant) submit a &lt;em&gt;Project Report&lt;/em&gt; describing the Phase I project activities and the Phase II proposal for further development. A panel of qualified experts will be convened to review the applications and score them based on the evaluation criteria described in Section V.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Partnerships with industry or non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are strongly encouraged, particularly in Phase II. These partners are expected to help further develop the design, demonstrate the project in the field, and/or move the design to the marketplace. Matching contributions are not required in either the Phase I or the Phase II competition; however, anticipated partnerships should be identified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although P3 grant funding must be used for research and cannot be used for commercialization and for-profit initiatives (such as business creation), proposals with commercial potential are encouraged to apply to EPA’s Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program.  Since its inception, EPA&#039;s SBIR Program has provided incentive funding to small businesses to translate their innovative ideas into commercial products that address environmental problems.  The EPA is one of 11 federal agencies that participate in the SBIR Program established by the Small Business Innovation Development Act of 1982. EPA issues annual solicitations for Phase I and Phase II research proposals from science and technology-based firms (not universities).  Many institutions have entrepreneurship centers where adjunct faculty are practicing entrepreneurs.  SBIR applicants are encouraged to consult with their university’s business or management school and entrepreneurship center faculty about how best to design their proposed research.  For more information on EPA’s SBIR Program see &lt;a href=&quot;/sbir&quot;&gt;Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program&lt;/a&gt;.  For more information about the federal SBIR Program see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sbir.gov/&quot;&gt;SBIR/STTR&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The specific Strategic Goal and Objective from the EPA’s Strategic Plan that relate to this solicitation are Goal 3: Cleaning up Communities and Advancing Sustainable Development, and Objective 3.1: Promote Sustainable and Livable Communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EPA’s FY 2014-18 Strategic Plan can be found at: &lt;a href=&quot;/planandbudget/strategicplan&quot;&gt;EPA Strategic Plan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preventing and reducing food waste&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		The EPA and the USDA are partnering through the U.S. Food Waste Challenge to address sustainable food management from farm to final disposition.  (&lt;a href=&quot;/sustainable-management-food/united-states-2030-food-loss-and-waste-reduction-goal&quot;&gt;United States 2030 Food Loss and Waste Reduction Goal&lt;/a&gt;)  Through this partnership, the EPA is working to reduce food waste, which is the largest component (21 percent) of discarded municipal solid waste.  Areas of interest include but are not limited to:
		&lt;ol class=&quot;mode-lower-alpha&quot; type=&quot;a&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improving food transportation, distribution, recovery, and secondary uses (see &lt;a href=&quot;/sustainable-management-food/food-recovery-hierarchy&quot;&gt;Food Recovery Hierarchy&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Broadening composting deployment, for instance by increasing awareness, making it easier to participate, improving collection, processing, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Water (Funding Opportunity Number: EPA-G2017-P3-Q4 – Water)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drinking Water&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		Considerations include cost, ease of use, social impacts, and environmental impacts including resource and energy use. Areas of interest include but are not limited to research on:
		&lt;ol class=&quot;mode-lower-alpha&quot; type=&quot;a&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Small drinking water systems.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Increasing disaster resilience by preventing pollutant release into drinking water sources during flood events.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;em&gt;NOTE:  Because the P3 program has already funded many arsenic-removal projects, additional arsenic-removal projects are highly discouraged.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Water Quality&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		Research areas of interest for ensuring long-term sustainability include the prevention and/or control of the man-made or man-induced alteration of the chemical, physical, biological, and radiological integrity of water, including freshwater aquatic ecosystems.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wastewater and Water Reuse&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		Areas of interest include but are not limited to:
		&lt;ol class=&quot;mode-lower-alpha&quot; type=&quot;a&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Treatment technologies to capture energy/resources.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Treatment technologies to enable a closed-loop residential system.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is recognized that some proposals may be appropriate for more than one FON/research area, but the applicant must identify a primary FON/research area for application submission purposes.  The primary FON/research area is used to determine the appropriate peer review panel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note the following Agency requirements for P3 research proposals:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;All proposals should clearly articulate how the proposed project/design will result in pollution prevention and/or control or describe how the proposed project/design proposes research within the scope of the statutes described in Section I.C.1. above. (NEPA is a secondary supporting statute for international projects and cannot be the sole supporting statute for a proposed project.)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Generally, a proposal to this solicitation should address the causes, effects, extent, prevention, reduction, and elimination of air pollution, water pollution, solid/hazardous waste pollution, toxic substances control, or pesticide control. Proposals should not focus on fixing an environmental problem via a well-established method, but instead highlight their innovative research aspects. For example, a proposal to plant some trees in an economically depressed area in order to prevent erosion, or a proposal to start a routine recycling or composting program would not be considered appropriate for the P3 Program. However, the first instance of the application of a pollution-control technique or an innovative application of a previously used method would be considered appropriate for the P3 Program.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;To the extent practicable, research proposals must embody innovation and sustainability.  Innovation for the purposes of this RFA is defined as the process of making changes; a new method, custom or device.  Innovative research can take the form of wholly new applications or applications that build on existing knowledge and approaches for new uses.  Research proposals must include a discussion on how the proposed research is innovative (see Section IV.C.5.a). The concept of sustainability is based on language in the U.S. National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA).  This definition is reiterated in Executive Order 13514, Federal Leadership in Environment, Energy, and Economic Performance, stating that the goal of sustainability is to, “create and maintain conditions, under which humans and nature can exist in productive harmony, that permit fulfilling the social, economic, and other requirements of present and future generations.” Research proposals must include a discussion on how the proposed research will seek sustainable solutions that protect the environment and strengthen our communities (see Section IV.C.5.a). ORD will draw from all of the above-mentioned innovation and sustainability definitions in the review/evaluation process of recommending research proposals (see Sections V.A and V.B).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Review criteria specific to the P3 Program are presented in Sections V.A. and V.B.&lt;/p&gt;

	Agency policy and ethical considerations prevent EPA technical staff and managers from providing applicants with information that may create an unfair competitive advantage.  Consequently, EPA employees will not review, comment, advise, and/or provide technical assistance to applicants preparing applications in response to EPA RFAs.  EPA employees cannot endorse any particular application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P3 Award projects (both Phase I &amp;amp; II) will not accommodate a multiple PI application.  P3 Award projects should be submitted as a single lead PI application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These awards may involve the collection of “Geospatial Information,” which includes information that identifies the geographic location and characteristics of natural or constructed features or boundaries on the Earth or applications, tools, and hardware associated with the generation, maintenance, or distribution of such information.  This information may be derived from, among other things, a Geographic Positioning System (GPS), remote sensing, mapping, charting, and surveying technologies, or statistical data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This solicitation provides the opportunity for the submission of applications for projects that may involve human subjects research. All applications must include a Human Subjects Research Statement (HSRS; described in Section IV.C.5.b of this solicitation). If the project involves human subjects research, it will be subject to an additional level of review prior to funding decisions being made as described in Sections V.C and V.D of this solicitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A P3 project may involve intellectual property (IP). If that is the case, P3 teams are encouraged to ensure that their institution’s technology transfer office reviews any IP-related materials before making them public. This is to ensure that any concerns related to patent filings or adjustments to IP strategies, if needed, can be addressed prior to any public display.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Groups of two or more eligible applicants may choose to form a consortium and submit a single application for this assistance agreement.  The application must identify which organization will be the recipient of the assistance agreement and which organizations(s) will be subawardees of the recipient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;AWARDII&quot; name=&quot;AWARDII&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;II. AWARD INFORMATION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	It is anticipated that a total of approximately $900,000 will be awarded under this announcement for Phase I and Phase II grant awards, depending on the availability of funds, quality of applications received, and other applicable considerations.  The EPA anticipates funding approximately 25 grants for Phase I under this RFA.  The projected EPA award amount for each Phase I grant is up to $15,000 for its one year duration.  Requests for amounts in excess of a total of $15,000, including direct and indirect costs, will not be considered. The total project period for an application submitted for a Phase I grant may not exceed one year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the completed Phase I project/design, the Phase II proposal to further develop and demonstrate the sustainability project/design created in Phase I, and the reviews from the reviewers, EPA will select approximately seven P3 Award winners from among recipients of Phase I funding, depending on the availability of funds and other applicable considerations. These P3 Award winners will be eligible to receive additional Phase II funding of up to $75,000 each. Proposals for Phase II grants with total budget requests exceeding $75,000, including direct and indirect costs, will not be considered.  The total project period for a Phase II grant may not exceed two years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EPA reserves the right to reject all applications and make no awards, or make fewer awards than anticipated, under this RFA.  The EPA reserves the right to make additional awards under this announcement, consistent with Agency policy, if additional funding becomes available after the original selections are made.  Any additional selections for awards will be made no later than six months after the original selection decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In appropriate circumstances, EPA reserves the right to partially fund proposals/applications by funding discrete portions or phases of proposed projects. If EPA decides to partially fund a proposal/application, it will do so in a manner that does not prejudice any applicants or affect the basis upon which the proposal/application, or portion thereof, was evaluated and selected for award, and therefore maintains the integrity of the competition and selection process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EPA intends to award only grants under this announcement. Under a &lt;em&gt;grant,&lt;/em&gt; EPA scientists and engineers are not permitted to be substantially involved in the execution of the research.  However, EPA encourages interaction between its own laboratory scientists and grant Principal Investigators after the award of an EPA grant for the sole purpose of exchanging information in research areas of common interest that may add value to their respective research activities.  This interaction must be incidental to achieving the goals of the research under a grant.  Interaction that is “incidental” does not involve resource commitments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;ELIGIBILITY_INFORMATION&quot; name=&quot;ELIGIBILITY_INFORMATION&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;III. ELIGIBILITY INFORMATION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;Eligible_Applicants&quot; name=&quot;Eligible_Applicants&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;A. Eligible Applicants&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Public nonprofit institutions/organizations (limited to degree-granting public institutions of higher education) and private nonprofit institutions/organizations (limited to degree-granting private institutions of higher education) located in the U.S. (includes eligible institutions of higher education located in U.S. territories and possessions) are eligible to apply to be the recipient of a grant to support teams of undergraduate and/or graduate students. Profit-making firms are not eligible to receive assistance agreements from the EPA under this program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The students on the teams supported by the institution receiving the grant must be enrolled in the college, university, or post-secondary educational institution they will be representing at the time the proposal is submitted. Institutions are allowed to submit more than one application where each application represents a unique design concept and student team. For the purposes of grant administration, the team&#039;s faculty advisor will be designated the Principal Investigator throughout the P3 grant award and competition process. In addition to the Principal Investigator, each team selected for award will also be asked to provide contact information for a student lead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eligible nonprofit organizations include research institutes, corporations, or foundations that are part of a U.S. institution of higher education. However, nonprofit organizations described in Section 501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code that lobby are not eligible to apply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreign governments, international organizations, and non-governmental international organizations/institutions are not eligible to apply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;National laboratories funded by Federal Agencies (Federally-Funded Research and Development Centers, &quot;FFRDCs&quot;) may not apply. FFRDC employees may cooperate or collaborate with eligible applicants within the limits imposed by applicable legislation and regulations. They may participate in planning, conducting, and analyzing the research directed by the applicant, but may not direct projects on behalf of the applicant organization. The institution, organization, or governance receiving the award may provide funds through its assistance agreement from the EPA to an FFRDC for supplies, equipment, and other expenses directly related to the research. However, salaries for permanent FFRDC employees may not be provided through this mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Federal Agencies may not apply. Federal employees are not eligible to serve in a principal leadership role on an assistance agreement, and may not receive salaries or augment their Agency&#039;s appropriations in other ways through awards made under this program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The applicant institution may enter into an agreement with a Federal Agency to purchase or utilize unique supplies or services unavailable in the private sector. Examples are purchase of satellite data, chemical reference standards, analyses, or use of instrumentation or other facilities not available elsewhere. A written justification for federal involvement must be included in the application. In addition, an appropriate form of assurance that documents the commitment, such as a letter of intent from the Federal Agency involved, should be included.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Potential applicants who are uncertain of their eligibility should contact &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:josephson.ron@epa.gov&quot;&gt;Ron Josephson&lt;/a&gt; (josephson.ron@epa.gov) in NCER; phone: 202-564-7823.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;Cost_Sharing&quot; name=&quot;Cost_Sharing&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;B. Cost Sharing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Institutional cost-sharing is not required for Phase I or Phase II.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;Other&quot; name=&quot;Other&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;C. Other&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Applications must substantially comply with the application submission instructions and requirements set forth in Section IV of this announcement or they will be rejected. In addition, where a page limitation is expressed in Section IV with respect to parts of the application, pages in excess of the page limit will not be reviewed. In addition, applications must be submitted through &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.Grants.gov&quot;&gt;Grants.gov&lt;/a&gt; as stated in Section IV of this announcement (except in the limited circumstances where another mode of submission is specifically allowed for as explained in Section IV) on or before the application submission deadline published in Section IV of this announcement. Applicants are responsible for following the submission instructions in Section IV of this announcement (see Section IV.F. “Submission Instructions and Other Submission Requirements” for further information) to ensure that their application is timely submitted. Applications submitted after the submission deadline will be considered late and deemed ineligible without further consideration unless the applicant can clearly demonstrate that it was late due to EPA mishandling or because of technical problems associated with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.Grants.gov&quot;&gt;Grants.gov&lt;/a&gt; or relevant &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sam.gov/portal/SAM/##11&quot;&gt;SAM.gov&lt;/a&gt; system issues. An applicant’s failure to timely submit their application through &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grants.gov&quot;&gt;Grants.gov&lt;/a&gt; because they did not timely or properly register in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sam.gov/portal/SAM/##11&quot;&gt;SAM.gov&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://Grants.gov&quot;&gt;Grants.gov&lt;/a&gt; will not be considered an acceptable reason to consider a late submission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, applications exceeding the funding limits or project period term described herein will be rejected without review. Further, applications that fail to demonstrate a public purpose of support or stimulation (e.g., by proposing research which primarily benefits a Federal program or provides a service for a Federal agency) will not be funded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applications deemed ineligible for funding consideration will be notified within fifteen calendar days of the ineligibility determination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, the competitors for the P3 Awards and the subsequent grant for further development and demonstration (Phase II) will be limited to those selected to receive support as a result of the competition under this RFA (Phase I).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;APPLICATION&quot; name=&quot;APPLICATION&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;IV. APPLICATION AND SUBMISSION INFORMATION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additional provisions that apply to this solicitation and/or awards made under this solicitation, including but not limited to those related to confidential business information, contracts and subawards under grants, and proposal assistance and communications, can be found at &lt;a href=&quot;/grants/epa-solicitation-clauses#Contracts%20and%20Subawards&quot;&gt;EPA Solicitation Clauses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These, and the other provisions that can be found at the website link, are important, and applicants must review them when preparing applications for this solicitation. If you are unable to access these provisions electronically at the website above, please communicate with the EPA contact listed in this solicitation to obtain the provisions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Formal instructions for submission through Grants.gov are in Section F.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the request, the applicant must include the following information:&lt;br /&gt;
	Funding Opportunity Number (FON)&lt;br /&gt;
	Organization Name and DUNS&lt;br /&gt;
	Organization’s Contact Information (email address and phone number)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Explanation of how they lack the technical capability to apply electronically through &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grants.gov&quot;&gt;Grants.gov&lt;/a&gt; because of: 1) limited internet access or 2) no internet access which prevents them from being able to upload the required application materials through &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.Grants.gov&quot;&gt;Grants.gov.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EPA will only consider alternate submission exception requests based on the two reasons stated above and will timely respond to the request -- all other requests will be denied. If an alternate submission method is approved, the applicant will receive documentation of this approval and further instructions on how to apply under this announcement. Applicants will be required to submit the documentation of approval with any initial application submitted under the alternative method. In addition, any submittal through an alternative method must comply with all applicable requirements and deadlines in the announcement including the submission deadline and requirements regarding proposal content and page limits (although the documentation of approval of an alternate submission method will not count against any page limits).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If an exception is granted, it is valid for submissions to EPA for the remainder of the entire calendar year in which the exception was approved and can be used to justify alternative submission methods for application submissions made through December 31 of the calendar year in which the exception was approved (e.g., if the exception was approved on March 1, 2015, it is valid for any competitive or non-competitive application submission to EPA through December 31, 2015). Applicants need only request an exception once in a calendar year and all exceptions will expire on December 31 of that calendar year. Applicants must request a new exception from required electronic submission through &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grants.gov&quot;&gt;Grants.gov&lt;/a&gt; for submissions for any succeeding calendar year. For example, if there is a competitive opportunity issued on December 1, 2015 with a submission deadline of January 15, 2016, the applicant would need a new exception to submit through alternative methods beginning January 1, 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note that the process described in this section is only for requesting alternate submission methods. All other inquiries about this announcement must be directed to the Agency Contact listed in Section VII of the announcement. Queries or requests submitted to the email address identified above for any reason other than to request an alternate submission method will not be acknowledged or answered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;Application_Package&quot; name=&quot;Application_Package&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B. Application Package Information&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Use the application package available at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grants.gov&quot;&gt;Grants.gov&lt;/a&gt; (see Section IV.F. “Submission Instructions and Other Submission Requirements”). Note: With the exception of the current and pending support form (available at &lt;a href=&quot;/research-grants/research-funding-opportunities-how-apply-and-required-forms&quot;&gt;How to Apply and Required Forms&lt;/a&gt;), all necessary forms are included in the electronic application package. Make sure to include the current and pending support form in your &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grants.gov&quot;&gt;Grants.gov&lt;/a&gt; submission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An email will be sent by NCER to the PI and the Administrative Contact (see below) to acknowledge receipt of the application and transmit other important information. The email will be sent from receipt.application@epa.gov; emails to this address will not be accepted. &lt;em&gt;If you do not receive an email acknowledgement within 10 calendar days of the submission closing date, immediately inform the Electronic Submissions Contact shown in this solicitation. Failure to do so may result in your application not being reviewed.&lt;/em&gt; See Section IV.F. “Submission Instructions and Other Submission Requirements” for additional information regarding the application receipt acknowledgment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;Content&quot; name=&quot;Content&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C. Content and Form of Application Submission&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The application is made by submitting the materials described below.  &lt;strong&gt;Applications must contain all information requested and be submitted in the formats described. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol class=&quot;mode-decimal&quot; type=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Standard Form 424&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;The applicant must complete Standard Form 424. Instructions for completion of the SF424 are included with the form. (However, note that EPA requires that the entire requested dollar amount appear on the SF424, not simply the proposed first year expenses.) The form must contain the signature of an authorized representative of the applying organization.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;Applicants are required to provide a unique entity identifier (formerly ‘DUNS number’) when applying for federal grants or cooperative agreements. Organizations may receive a unique entity identifier, at no cost, by calling the dedicated toll-free request line at 1-866-705-5711, or visiting the website at: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dnb.com&quot;&gt;Dun &amp;amp; Bradstreet&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;exit-disclaimer&quot; href=&quot;/home/exit-epa&quot; title=&quot;EPA&#039;s External Link Disclaimer&quot;&gt;Exit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;Executive Order 12372, “Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs,” does not apply to the Office of Research and Development&#039;s research and training programs unless EPA has determined that the activities that will be carried out under the applicants&#039; proposal (a) require an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), or (b) do not require an EIS but will be newly initiated at a particular site and require unusual measures to limit the possibility of adverse exposure or hazard to the general public, or (c) have a unique geographic focus and are directly relevant to the governmental responsibilities of a State or local government within that geographic area.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;If EPA determines that Executive Order 12372 applies to an applicant&#039;s proposal, the applicant must follow the procedures in 40 CFR Part 29. The applicant must notify their state&#039;s single point of contact (SPOC). To determine whether their state participates in this process, and how to comply, applicants should consult &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/grants_spoc/&quot;&gt;Intergovernmental Review (SPOC List)&lt;/a&gt;. If an applicant is in a State that does not have a SPOC, or the State has not selected research and development grants for intergovernmental review, the applicant must notify directly affected State, area wide, regional and local entities of its proposal.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;EPA will notify the successful applicant(s) if Executive Order 12372 applies to its proposal prior to award.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Research Plan (12 pages)&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Note: Please review the Evaluation Criteria presented in Section V.A. to ensure that your proposal addresses all of the criteria against which it will be evaluated by the external and internal reviewers.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;This plan must not exceed twelve (12) consecutively numbered (bottom center) 8.5x11-inch pages of single-spaced, standard 12-point type with 1-inch margins. While these guidelines establish the minimum type size requirements, applicants are advised that readability is of paramount importance and should take precedence in selection of an appropriate font for use in the plan.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Divide your research plan into the following sections and label accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Section 1: Proposed Research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;ol class=&quot;mode-lower-alpha&quot; type=&quot;a&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Challenge Definition&lt;/strong&gt;

						&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Identify the technical challenge to achieving sustainability the team will research.&lt;/li&gt;
							&lt;li&gt;Identify the research project’s innovative aspects by describing how it shifts current research or engineering paradigms by using innovative theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation or interventions applicable to one or more fields of research. Where appropriate, put the research in the context of current approaches (e.g., provide a literature review).&lt;/li&gt;
						&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research Description&lt;/strong&gt;
						&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Describe the research and its goals and objectives.&lt;/li&gt;
							&lt;li&gt;Explain the scientific/technical soundness and trade-offs involved in the proposed design.&lt;/li&gt;
							&lt;li&gt;Explain the plan for engaging intended end users.&lt;/li&gt;
							&lt;li&gt;State how the research relates to pollution prevention/control or link it to one of EPA’s authorizing statutes provided in &lt;a href=&quot;#Authorities_Regulations&quot;&gt;Section I.C.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
							&lt;li&gt;If appropriate, identify any existing or potential partnerships*.&lt;/li&gt;
						&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results (outputs/outcomes), Evaluation and Demonstration&lt;/strong&gt;
						&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Describe the expected outputs and the potential outcomes to society, the economy and the environment (See &lt;a href=&quot;#Interest/Expected_Outputs&quot;&gt;Section I.D.&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
							&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Describe how progress toward achieving the expected outputs and outcomes will be tracked and measured.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
						&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Section 2: Relationship of Challenge to Sustainability (People, Prosperity and the Planet)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Describe how your project embodies the principles of sustainability and seeks sustainable solutions that protect the environment and strengthen our communities. The &lt;a href=&quot;/sites/production/files/2015-05/documents/sustainability_primer_v9.pdf&quot;&gt;Sustainability Primer (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;fileinfo&quot;&gt;(2 pp, 195 K)&lt;/span&gt; provides examples of research activities that promote and incorporate sustainability principles.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Describe how the proposed environmental and economic outcomes could benefit the intended users and/or society more generally.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Describe the potential for implementation, adoption, concept transferability, and long-term viability of the research.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Section 3: Project Management&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Provide schedules for key milestones and project tasks, including partner activities as appropriate.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Provide the areas of expertise/experience to be represented on the student team.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Discuss facilities and other resources available for the project.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Detail how project objectives will be successfully achieved within the grant period and describe the approach, procedures and controls for ensuring that grant funds will be expended in a timely and efficient manner.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Section 4: Educational and Interdisciplinary Aspects of Research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Identify the educational benefits of the research. (Will it be used to teach sustainability principles, promote sustainability practices in a community, and teach team members how to apply sustainability principles or all of the above?)&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Clearly identify the planned mix of disciplines to be represented on the team.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Partnerships are strongly encouraged and will be particularly important for the demonstration strategies. While formal partnerships need not be established prior to submitting the proposal, indicate any and all anticipated partnerships including the type of partner (educational institution, industry and/or NGOs). Formal letters of understanding or commitment from any and all partners should be submitted in support of the application, when available and appropriate and will be considered letters of intent/support as described in Section IV.C.9.a. below.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EPA Human Subjects Research Statement (HSRS) (4 pages)&lt;/strong&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;Human subjects research supported by the EPA is governed by EPA Regulation 40 CFR Part 26 (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title40/40cfr26_main_02.tpl&quot;&gt;Protection of Human Subjects&lt;/a&gt;). This includes the Common Rule at subpart A and prohibitions and additional protections for pregnant women and fetuses, nursing women, and children at subparts B, C, and D. While retaining the same notation, subparts B, C, and D are substantively different in 40 CFR Part 26 than in the more commonly cited 45 CFR 46. Particularly noteworthy is that research meeting the regulatory definition of intentional exposure research found in subpart B is prohibited by that subpart in pregnant women, nursing women, and children. Research meeting the regulatory definition of observational research (any research that is not intentional exposure research) found in subparts C and D is subject to the additional protections found in those subparts for pregnant women and fetuses (subpart C) and children (subpart D). These subparts also differ markedly from the language in 45 CFR 46. For more information, please see: &lt;a href=&quot;/osa/basic-information-about-human-subjects-research-0&quot;&gt;Basic Information about Human Subjects Research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Procedures for the review and oversight of human research subject to 40 CFR Part 26 are also provided in &lt;a href=&quot;/osa/epa-order-100017-policy-and-procedures-protection-human-research-subjects-epa-conducted-or&quot;&gt;EPA Order 1000.17A&lt;/a&gt;. These include review of projects for EPA-supported human research by the EPA Human Subjects Research Review Official (HSRRO). Additional requirements must be met and final approval received from the HSRRO before the research can begin. When reviewing human observational exposure studies, EPA Order 1000.17A requires the HSRRO to apply the principles described in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPDF.cgi/P10012LY.PDF?Dockey=P10012LY.PDF&quot;&gt;SEAOES (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;fileinfo&quot;&gt;(132 pp, 1.79 MB)&lt;/span&gt; document and grant approval only to studies that adhere to those principles.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;All applications submitted under this solicitation must include a HSRS as described below. For more information about what constitutes human subjects research, please see: &lt;a href=&quot;/osa/basic-information-about-human-subjects-research-0&quot;&gt;Basic Information about Human Subjects Research&lt;/a&gt;. For information on the prohibition on the inclusion of vulnerable subjects in intentional exposure research, please see: &lt;a href=&quot;/osa/basic-information-about-human-subjects-research-0&quot;&gt;Basic Information about Human Subjects Research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human Subjects Research Statement (HSRS) Requirements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;If the proposed research &lt;strong&gt;does not&lt;/strong&gt; involve human subjects as defined above, provide the following statement in your application package as your HSRS: “The proposed research does not involve human subjects.” Applicants should provide a clear justification about how the proposed research does not meet the definition (for example, all samples come from deceased individuals OR samples are purchased from a commercial source and provided without identifiers, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;If the proposed research &lt;strong&gt;does&lt;/strong&gt; involve human subjects, then include in your application package a HSRS that addresses each applicable section listed below, referencing the specific location of the information in the Research Plan, providing the information in the HSRS, or explaining why the section does not apply to the proposed research. (Not all will apply.) Please note that even research that has been determined to be exempt from the human subjects regulations by an IRB must be reviewed by the EPA HSRRO. Therefore, consider exempt research to include human subjects work for this EPA solicitation. Do not exceed &lt;strong&gt;four&lt;/strong&gt; consecutively numbered, 8.5x11-inch pages of single-spaced, standard 12-point type with 1-inch margins. The factors below are not intended to be exhaustive of all those needed for the HSRRO to provide the final approval necessary for research to be conducted, but provide a basis upon which the human subjects oversight review may begin.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;NOTE: Researchers must provide evidence of an assurance on file with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) or other Federal Agency that it will comply with regulatory provisions in the Common Rule. In special circumstances where there is no such assurance, EPA will work with investigators to obtain an assurance from HHS or another source.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Complete all items below for studies involving human subjects. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Protection of Human Subjects (*Adapted from National Institutes of Health Supplemental Instructions for PHS 398 and SF424 (R&amp;amp;R) II-10)&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;Risks to Human Subjects&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;ol class=&quot;mode-lower-alpha&quot; type=&quot;a&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Human Subjects Involvement, Characteristics, and Design
								&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Describe and justify the proposed involvement of human subjects in the work outlined in the Research Strategy section.&lt;/li&gt;
									&lt;li&gt;Describe the characteristics of the subject population, including their anticipated number, age range, and health status, if relevant.&lt;/li&gt;
									&lt;li&gt;Describe and justify the sampling plan, including retention strategies and the criteria for inclusion or exclusion of any subpopulation.&lt;/li&gt;
									&lt;li&gt;Explain the rationale for the involvement of special vulnerable populations, such as pregnant women, children, or others who may be considered vulnerable populations&lt;/li&gt;
									&lt;li&gt;If relevant to the proposed research, describe procedures for assignment to a study group. As related to human subjects protection, describe and justify the selection of an intervention’s dose, frequency and administration.&lt;/li&gt;
									&lt;li&gt;List any collaborating sites where human subjects research will be performed, and describe the role of those sites and collaborating investigators in performing the proposed research. Explain how data from the site(s) will be obtained, managed, and protected.&lt;/li&gt;
								&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
							&lt;li&gt;Sources of Materials
								&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Describe the research material obtained from living individuals in the form of specimens, records, or data.&lt;/li&gt;
									&lt;li&gt;Describe any data that will be collected from human subjects for the project(s) described in the application.&lt;/li&gt;
									&lt;li&gt;Indicate who will have access to individually identifiable private information about human subjects.&lt;/li&gt;
									&lt;li&gt;Provide information about how the specimens, records, and/or data are collected, managed, and protected as well as whether material or data that include individually identifiable private information will be collected specifically for the proposed research project.&lt;/li&gt;
								&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
							&lt;li&gt;Potential Risks
								&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Describe all the potential risks to subjects posed by participation in the research (physical, psychological, financial, legal, or other), and assess their likelihood and seriousness to the human subjects.&lt;/li&gt;
									&lt;li&gt;Where appropriate, describe alternative treatments and procedures, including the risks and potential benefits of the alternative treatments and procedures, to participants in the proposed research.&lt;/li&gt;
								&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
						&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;
						&lt;p&gt;Adequacy of Protection Against Risks&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;ol class=&quot;mode-lower-alpha&quot; type=&quot;a&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Recruitment and Informed Consent
								&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Describe plans for the recruitment of subjects (where appropriate) and the process for obtaining informed consent. If the proposed studies will include children, describe the process for meeting requirements for parental permission and child assent.&lt;/li&gt;
									&lt;li&gt;Include a description of the circumstances under which consent will be sought and obtained, who will seek it, the nature of the information to be provided to prospective subjects, and the method of documenting consent. If a waiver of some or all of the elements of informed consent will be sought, provide justification for the waiver.&lt;/li&gt;
								&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
							&lt;li&gt;Protections Against Risk
								&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Describe planned procedures for protecting against or minimizing potential risks, including risks to privacy of individuals or confidentiality of data, and assess their likely effectiveness.&lt;/li&gt;
									&lt;li&gt;Research involving vulnerable populations, as described in the EPA regulations, Subparts B-D, must include additional protections. Refer to EPA guidance:&lt;/li&gt;
									&lt;li&gt;Prohibition of Research Conducted or Supported by EPA Involving Intentional Exposure of Human Subjects who are Children or Pregnant or Nursing Women &lt;a href=&quot;/osa/basic-information-about-human-subjects-research-0&quot;&gt;Basic Information about Human Subjects Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
									&lt;li&gt;Additional Protections for Pregnant Women and Fetuses Involved as Subjects in Observational Research Conducted or Supported by EPA &lt;a href=&quot;/osa/basic-information-about-human-subjects-research-0&quot;&gt;Basic Information about Human Subjects Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
									&lt;li&gt;Additional Protections for Children Involved as Subjects in Observational Research Conducted or Supported by EPA &lt;a href=&quot;/osa/basic-information-about-human-subjects-research-0&quot;&gt;Basic Information about Human Subjects Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
									&lt;li&gt;Where appropriate, discuss plans for ensuring necessary medical or professional intervention in the event of adverse effects to the subjects. Studies that involve clinical trials must include a general description of the plan for data and safety monitoring of the clinical trials and adverse event reporting to the IRB, the DSMB (if one has been established for the trial), the EPA and others, as appropriate, to ensure the safety of subjects.&lt;/li&gt;
								&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
						&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;
						&lt;p&gt;Potential Benefits of the Proposed Research to Human Subjects and Others&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Discuss the potential benefits of the research to research participants and others.&lt;/li&gt;
							&lt;li&gt;Discuss why the risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to the anticipated benefits to research participants and others.&lt;/li&gt;
							&lt;li&gt;Please note that financial compensation of subjects is not considered to be a benefit of participation in research.&lt;/li&gt;
						&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;
						&lt;p&gt;Importance of the Knowledge to be Gained&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Discuss the importance of the knowledge to be gained as a result of the proposed research.&lt;/li&gt;
							&lt;li&gt;Discuss why the risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to the importance of the knowledge that reasonably may be expected to result.&lt;/li&gt;
						&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note that an Interventional Study (or Clinical Trial)&lt;/strong&gt; is a clinical study in which participants are assigned to receive one or more interventions (or no intervention) so that researchers can evaluate the effects of the interventions on biomedical or health-related outcomes; the assignments are determined by the study protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;References&lt;/strong&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;References cited are in addition to other page limits (e.g., research plan, quality assurance statement).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Budget and Budget Justification&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;ol class=&quot;mode-lower-alpha&quot; type=&quot;a&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Budget
				&lt;p&gt;Prepare a master budget table using “SF-424A Budget Information for Non-Construction Programs” (aka SF-424A), available in the Grants.gov electronic application package and also at &lt;a href=&quot;/research-grants/research-funding-opportunities-how-apply-and-required-forms&quot;&gt;How to Apply and Required Forms&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Only complete “Section B-Budget Categories”.&lt;/strong&gt; Provide the object class budget category (a. - k.) amounts under the “Grant Program, Function or Activity” heading. Each column reflects a separate budget year. Since P3 Phase I grants are one-year grants you will only need to fill in the Year 1 column which will automatically be copied into the total budget column (Column 5).&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Applicants may not use subagreements to transfer or delegate their responsibility for successful completion of their EPA assistance agreement. Please refer to &lt;a href=&quot;/grants/epa-solicitation-clauses#contractssubawards&quot;&gt;EPA Solicitation Clauses&lt;/a&gt; if your organization intends to identify specific contractors, including consultants, and subawardees in your proposal.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Please note that institutional cost-sharing is not required and should not be included.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;The budget must include expenses for the P3 team, or representatives of the P3 team, to travel in the spring of 2018 to the Washington, DC metropolitan area to present their research.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;Budget Justification&lt;em&gt; [3 pages in addition to the Section IV.C.5. page limitations]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Describe the basis for calculating the travel, equipment, supplies, contractual support, and other costs identified in the SF-424A. The budget justification should not exceed three consecutively numbered (bottom center), 8.5x11-inch pages of single-spaced, standard 12-point type with 1-inch margins.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Budget information should be supported at the level of detail described below.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;A sample budget justification is provided below followed by EPA requirements. All funds will be used in accordance with the budget justification guidelines detailed in this section.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personnel and Fringe Benefits:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

				&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EPA Budget Requirements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;ol type=&quot;i&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personnel: Personnel costs are not eligible under this solicitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fringe Benefits: Fringe benefits are not eligible under this solicitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Travel: Be certain to include travel costs for an estimated number of P3 team members to travel to the Washington DC metropolitan area to present their research in the spring of 2018. Specify the estimated number of trips, purpose of each trip, number of travelers per trip, destinations, and other costs for each type of travel. Explain the need for any travel, paying particular attention to travel outside the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Equipment: Identify all tangible, non-expendable personal property to be purchased that has an estimated cost of $5,000 or more per unit and a useful life of more than one year. It does not include: (1) equipment planned to be leased/rented, including lease/purchase agreements; or (2) equipment service or maintenance contracts. Details such as the type of equipment, cost, and a brief narrative on the intended use of the equipment for project objectives are required. Each item of equipment must be identified with the corresponding cost. General-purpose equipment (office equipment, etc.) must be justified as to how it will be used on the project. (Property items with a unit cost of less than $5,000 are considered supplies.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supplies: “Supplies” means tangible property other than “equipment.” Identify supplies to be used under the project.  This may include: software, office supplies, and laboratory supplies such as reagents, chemicals and glassware. Specifically identify computers to be purchased or upgraded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contractual: Specify the purpose of the proposed contract/procurement, the proposed duration of the contract/procurement, the estimated cost, and the proposed procurement method (competitive or non-competitive).  &lt;strong&gt;Any procurement of services from individual consultants or commercial firms (including space for workshops) must comply with the competitive procurement requirements of 2 CFR Part 200.317-200.326. Please see &lt;a href=&quot;/grants/epa-solicitation-clauses#contractssubawards&quot;&gt;EPA Solicitation Clauses&lt;/a&gt; for more details.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dt&gt;Examples of Contractual costs include:&lt;/dt&gt;
					&lt;dd&gt;Consultants – Consultants are individuals with specialized skills who are paid at a daily or hourly rate. EPA’s participation in the salary rate (excluding overhead) paid to individual consultants retained by recipients or by a recipient&#039;s contractors or subcontractors is limited to the maximum daily rate for a Level IV of the Executive Schedule (formerly GS-18), to be adjusted annually.&lt;/dd&gt;
					&lt;dd&gt;Speaker/Trainer Fees – Information on speakers should include the fee and a description of the services they are providing.&lt;/dd&gt;
				&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other: List each item in sufficient detail for the EPA to determine the reasonableness of its cost relative to the research to be undertaken. “Other” items may include publication costs, long distance telephone charges, and photocopying costs.  Note that subawards, such as those with other universities or nonprofit research institutions for members of the research team, are included in this category. &lt;strong&gt;Provide the total costs proposed for subawards as a separate line item in the budget justification and brief description of the activities to be supported for each subaward or types of subawards if the subrecipients have not been identified.&lt;/strong&gt; Subawards may not be used to acquire services from consultants or commercial firms. Please see &lt;a href=&quot;/grants/epa-solicitation-clauses#contractssubawards&quot;&gt;EPA Solicitation Clauses&lt;/a&gt; for more details.  The “Other” budget category also includes participant support costs such as stipends or travel assistance for trainees (e.g. interns or fellows).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indirect Costs: Indirect costs are those incurred by the applicant for a common or joint purpose that benefit more than one cost objective or project, and are not readily assignable to specific cost objectives or projects as a direct cost. In order for indirect costs to be allowable, the applicant must have a negotiated indirect cost rate (e.g., fixed, predetermined, final or provisional), or must have submitted a proposal to their cognizant agency. If indirect costs are included in the budget, identify the cognizant agency and the approved indirect rate.  If your organization does not have a cognizant agency, please note that in the budget justification and provide a brief explanation for how you calculated your indirect cost rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resumes &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Provide resumes for each investigator and important co-worker. You may include resumes from staff of subawardees such as universities. Do not include resumes of consultants or other contractors. The resume is not limited to traditional materials, but should provide materials to clearly and appropriately demonstrate that the investigator has the knowledge needed to perform their component of the proposed research. The resume for each individual must not exceed two consecutively numbered (bottom center), 8.5x11-inch pages of single-spaced, standard 12-point type with 1-inch margins.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;Alternative to a standard resume, you may use a profile such as an NIH BioSketch that can be generated in SciENcv (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://rbm.nih.gov/profile_project.htm&quot;&gt;SciENcv&lt;/a&gt; for information on SciENcv; also see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/techbull/so13/so13_sciencv.html&quot;&gt;My NCBI Curriculum Vitae Web Application: SciENcv&lt;/a&gt;). These materials should generally conform to the requirements for a resume (e.g., content and page number).&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current and Pending Support&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;Complete a current and pending support form (provided at &lt;a href=&quot;/research-grants/research-funding-opportunities-how-apply-and-required-forms&quot;&gt;How to Apply and Required Forms&lt;/a&gt;) for each investigator and important co-worker. Do not include current and pending support for consultants or other contractors. Include all current and pending research regardless of source.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note to all prospective applicants requiring multiple Current and Pending Support Form pages:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Due to a limitation in Adobe Acrobat&#039;s forms functionality, additional pages cannot be directly inserted into the original PDF form and preserve the form data on the subsequent pages. Multiple page form submissions can be created in Acrobat 8 and later using the &quot;PDF Package&quot; option in the &quot;Create PDF from Multiple Files&quot; function. If you have an earlier version of Adobe Standard or Professional, applicants will need to convert each PDF page of the form to an EPS (Encapsulated Post Script) file before creating the PDF for submission. The following steps will allow applicants with earlier versions of Adobe Standard or Professional to create a PDF package:&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;ol class=&quot;mode-decimal&quot; type=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Populate the first page of the PDF, and save it as an EPS (Encapsulated Post Script) file.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Reopen the form, and populate it with the data for page 2. Save this page as a different EPS file. Repeat for as many pages as necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Use Acrobat Distiller to convert the EPS files back to PDF.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Open Acrobat Professional, and combine the individual pages into a combined PDF file.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guidelines, Limitations, and Additional Requirements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;ol class=&quot;mode-lower-alpha&quot; type=&quot;a&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;Letters of Intent/Letters of Support&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Letters of intent&lt;/em&gt; to provide resources for the proposed research or to document intended interactions are limited to one brief paragraph committing the availability of a resource (e.g., use of a person&#039;s time or equipment) or intended interaction (e.g., sharing of data, as-needed consultation) that is described in the Research Plan. Letters of intent are to be included as an addition to the budget justification documents. EPA employees are not permitted to provide letters of intent for any application.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Letters of support&lt;/em&gt; do not commit a resource vital to the success of the proposal. A letter of support is written by businesses, organizations, or community members stating their support of the applicant&#039;s proposed project. EPA employees are not permitted to provide letters of support for any application.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Note: Letters of intent or support must be part of the application; letters submitted separately will not be accepted. Any letter of intent or support that exceeds one brief paragraph (excluding letterhead and salutations), is considered part of the Research Plan and is included in the 15-page Research Plan limit. Any transactions between the successful applicant and parties providing letters of intent or support financed with EPA grant funds are subject to the contract and subaward requirements described here &lt;a href=&quot;/grants/epa-solicitation-clauses#contractssubawards&quot;&gt;EPA Solicitation Clauses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Funding Opportunity Number (FON) and Research Areas
				&lt;p&gt;At various places in the application, applicants are asked to identify the FON. Applicants must select the FON corresponding to either the regular award or the early career award. It is the responsibility of the applicant to identify the proper FON. Failure to do so could result in an inappropriate peer review assignment. &lt;strong&gt;Each application must be submitted using a single FON.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;The Funding Opportunity Numbers and associated research areas for this RFA are listed below:&lt;/p&gt;
				14th Annual P3 Awards: A National Student Design Competition for Sustainability Focusing on People, Prosperity and the Planet

				&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dd&gt;EPA-G2017-P3-Q1 – Energy&lt;br /&gt;

						EPA-G2017-P3-Q3 – Materials and Chemicals&lt;br /&gt;
						EPA-G2017-P3-Q4 – Water&lt;/dd&gt;
				&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional detail for each FON is provided above in Section I.E.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Confidentiality
				&lt;p&gt;By submitting an application in response to this solicitation, the applicant grants the EPA permission to make limited disclosures of the application to technical reviewers both within and outside the Agency for the express purpose of assisting the Agency with evaluating the application. Information from a pending or unsuccessful application will be kept confidential to the fullest extent allowed under law; information from a successful application may be publicly disclosed to the extent permitted by law.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;Submission&quot; name=&quot;Submission&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;D. Submission Dates and Times &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Applications must be transferred to Grants.gov no later than 11:59:59 pm Eastern Time on the solicitation closing date. Applications transferred after the closing date and time will be returned to the sender without further consideration. EPA will not accept any changes to applications after the closing date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that this schedule may be changed without prior notification because of factors not anticipated at the time of announcement. In the case of a change in the solicitation closing date, a new date will be posted on &lt;a href=&quot;/research-grants&quot;&gt;EPA’s Research Grants website&lt;/a&gt; and a modification posted on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grants.gov&quot;&gt;Grants.gov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solicitation Closing Date: February 3, 2017, 11:59:59 pm Eastern Time (applications must be submitted to Grants.gov by this time, see Section IV.F. “Submission Instructions for Phase I Applications and Other Submission Requirements” for further information).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NOTE: Customarily, applicants are notified about evaluation decisions within six months of the solicitation closing date. Awards are generally made 9-12 months after the solicitation closing date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;Funding_Restrictions&quot; name=&quot;Funding_Restrictions&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;E. Funding Restrictions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The funding mechanism for all awards issued under the P3 solicitation will consist of assistance agreements from the EPA.  All award decisions are subject to the availability of funds.  In accordance with the Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act, 31 U.S.C. 6301 et seq., the primary purpose of an assistance agreement is to accomplish a public purpose of support or stimulation authorized by federal statute, rather than acquisition for the direct benefit or use of the Agency.  In issuing a grant, the EPA anticipates that there will be no substantial EPA involvement in the design, implementation, or conduct of the research.  However, the EPA will monitor research progress through annual reports provided by grantees and other contacts, including site visits, with the Principal Investigator(s).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EPA award recipients may incur allowable project costs 90 calendar days before the Federal awarding agency makes the Federal award. Expenses more than 90 calendar days pre-award require prior approval of EPA. All costs incurred before EPA makes the award are at the recipient&#039;s risk. EPA is under no obligation to reimburse such costs if for any reason the recipient does not receive a Federal award or if the Federal award is less than anticipated and inadequate to cover such costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you wish to submit applications for more than one EPA funding opportunity you must ensure that the research proposed in each application is significantly different from any other that has been submitted to the EPA or from any other financial assistance you are currently receiving from the EPA or other federal government agency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collaborative applications involving more than one institution must be submitted as a single administrative package from one of the institutions involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each proposed project must be able to be completed within the project period and with the initial award of funds.  Applicants should request the entire amount of money needed to complete the project.  Recipients should not anticipate additional funding beyond the initial award of funds for a specific project. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;Other_Requirements&quot; name=&quot;Other_Requirements&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;F. Submission Instructions for Phase I Applications and Other Submission Requirements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please read this entire section before attempting an electronic submission through Grants.gov.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the application package has been completed, the “Submit” button should be enabled.  If the “Submit” button is not active, please call Grants.gov for assistance at 1-800-518-4726.  Applicants who are outside the U.S. at the time of submittal and are not able to access the toll-free number may reach a Grants.gov representative by calling 606-545-5035.  Investigators should save the completed application package with two different file names before providing it to the AOR to avoid having to re-create the package should submission problems be experienced or a revised application needs to be submitted.  Note:  Revised applications must be submitted before the solicitation closing date and time.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Submitting the application.  The application package must be transferred to Grants.gov by an AOR.  The AOR should close all other software before attempting to submit the application package.  Click the “submit” button of the application package. Your Internet browser will launch and a sign-in page will appear.  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note:  Minor problems are not uncommon with transfers to Grants.gov.  It is essential to allow sufficient time to ensure that your application is submitted to Grants.gov BEFORE 11:59:59 pm Eastern Time on the solicitation closing date.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  The Grants.gov support desk operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week, except Federal Holidays.
		&lt;p&gt;A successful transfer will end with an on-screen acknowledgement.  For documentation purposes, print or screen capture this acknowledgement.  If a submission problem occurs, reboot the computer – turning the power off may be necessary – and re-attempt the submission.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;Note:  Grants.gov issues a “case number” upon a request for assistance.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Transmission Difficulties.  If transmission difficulties that result in a late transmission, no transmission, or rejection of the transmitted application are experienced, and following the above instructions do not resolve the problem so that the application is submitted to Grants.Gov by the deadline date and time, follow the guidance below.  The Agency will make a decision concerning each late submission on a case-by-case basis as to whether it should be forwarded for peer review.  All emails, as described below, are to be sent to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:jones.debram@epa.gov&quot;&gt;Debra M. Jones&lt;/a&gt; (jones.debram@epa.gov) with the FON in the subject line.
		&lt;p&gt;Be aware that EPA will only consider accepting applications that were unable to transmit due to Grants.gov or relevant &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sam.gov/portal/SAM/#1&quot;&gt;Sam.gov&lt;/a&gt; system issues or for unforeseen exigent circumstances, such as extreme weather interfering with internet access. Failure of an applicant to submit timely because they did not properly or timely register in SAM.gov or Grants.gov is not an acceptable reason to justify acceptance of a late submittal.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;Please note that if the application you are submitting is greater than 70 MB in size, please call or send an email message to the Electronic Submissions Contact listed for this RFA.  The Agency may experience technical difficulty downloading files of this size from Grants.gov.  Therefore, it is important that the Agency verify that the file can be downloaded.  The Agency will provide alternate submission instructions if the file cannot be downloaded.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;ol class=&quot;mode-lower-alpha&quot; type=&quot;a&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you are experiencing problems resulting in an inability to upload the application to Grants.gov, it is essential to call Grants.gov for assistance at 1-800-518-4726 before the application deadline.  Applicants who are outside the U.S. at the time of submittal and are not able to access the toll-free number may reach a Grants.gov representative by calling 606-545-5035.  Be &lt;em&gt;sure&lt;/em&gt; to obtain a case number from Grants.gov. If the problems stem from unforeseen exigent circumstances unrelated to Grants.gov, such as extreme weather interfering with internet access, contact &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:jones.debram@epa.gov&quot;&gt;Debra M. Jones&lt;/a&gt; (jones.debram@epa.gov).&lt;/li&gt;

Submission Instructions for Phase II Applications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additional submission instructions for the Phase II competition will be provided to the Phase I awardees in the award terms and conditions. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those receiving funding via a P3 Phase I grant are encouraged to apply for funding for a Phase II grant. Phase II proposals require many of the same documents as submitted for the Phase I grant. Phase II awards are separate grant awards. The proposal for a P3 Phase II grant, which is a component of the Phase I Project Report, will be due in March of 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol class=&quot;mode-decimal&quot; type=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;External Peer Review&lt;/strong&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;All eligible grant applications are reviewed by appropriate external technical peer reviewers based on the criteria and process described below. This review is designed to evaluate each application according to how well it meets the criteria listed below. The individual external peer reviewers include non-EPA scientists, engineers, social scientists, and/or economists who are accomplished in their respective disciplines and proficient in the technical subjects they are reviewing.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;Prior to the external technical peer review panel meeting, all reviewers will receive electronic copies of all applications, as well as a full set of abstracts for the applications. Each application will be assigned to a minimum of three primary peer reviewers, one of whom will be assigned the role of Rapporteur. Each reviewer will be assigned up to approximately 10 applications on which to serve as a primary reviewer. During the review period leading up to the panel meeting, primary reviewers will read the full set of abstracts and entire application package for each application they are assigned. They will also prepare a written individual evaluation for each assigned application that addresses the peer review criteria described below and rate the application with a score of highly recommend, recommend, or not recommend.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the panel meeting, each primary reviewer will report their ratings for the applications they reviewed. Those applications receiving at least two ratings of Recommend or one rating of Highly Recommend from among the primary reviewers will then be further discussed by the panel in terms of the peer review criteria below. In addition, if there is one Recommend rating among the primary reviewers of an application, the primary reviewer, who’s initial rating is the Recommend, may request discussion of the application by the peer review panel. All other applications will be declined for further consideration.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;After the discussion of an application by the panel, the primary reviewers may revise their initial ratings; and if they do so this will also be documented. The final ratings of the primary reviewers will then be translated by EPA into the final peer review score (highly recommend, recommend, or not recommend) for the application. This is reflected in a peer review results document developed by the Rapporteur, which combines the individual initial and final evaluations of the primary reviewers and captures any substantive comments from the panel discussion. This score will be used to determine which applications undergo the internal programmatic review discussed below. A peer review results document is also developed for applications that are not discussed. However this document is a consolidation of the individual primary reviewer initial evaluations, with an average of the scores assigned by the primary reviewers.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Criteria for External Peer Review of Phase I Awards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			All eligible grant applications for Phase I awards will be peer reviewed by an external peer review panel based on the criteria below. Each of the four criteria categories are equally weighted.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;ol class=&quot;mode-lower-alpha&quot; type=&quot;a&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proposal Quality&lt;/strong&gt; (the subcriteria identified within this criteria are essentially equally weighted) - The degree to which the application includes a plan for scientifically sound, feasible and appropriate research; challenges and seeks to shift current research or engineering paradigms by using innovative theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation or interventions; clearly expresses its innovative aspects (supported by a literature review where appropriate); lists clear, achievable goals and objectives; identifies and suitably engages end users; and describes any partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overall Sustainability&lt;/strong&gt; (the subcriteria identified within this criteria are essentially equally weighted) – The degree to which the proposed research embodies the principles of sustainability and offers sustainable solutions that protect the environment and strengthen communities; demonstrates how its environmental and economic outcomes will benefit the intended users and/or society; and describes its potential for implementation, adoption, transferability and long-term viability. The &lt;a href=&quot;/sites/production/files/2015-05/documents/sustainability_primer_v9.pdf&quot;&gt;Sustainability Primer (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;fileinfo&quot;&gt;(2 pp, 195 K)&lt;/span&gt; describes sustainability concepts in more detail.)&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education and Teamwork&lt;/strong&gt; - The degree to which the project serves as a sustainability teaching tool and is appropriate for an interdisciplinary student team (graduate and undergraduate, as needed).&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Budget and Project Management&lt;/strong&gt; (the subcriteria identified within this criteria are essentially equally weighted)- The degree to which the application provides a reasonable and appropriate budget and includes approaches, procedures, and controls for ensuring timely and efficient expenditure of awarded grant funds; adequately describes expertise, facilities and other resources; provides a schedule with milestones for ensuring successful achievement of project objectives; and describes how outputs and social, economic and environmental outcomes will be tracked and measured.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Programmatic Review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			Applications receiving final peer review scores of highly recommend or recommend will then undergo an internal programmatic review, as described below, conducted by technical experts from the EPA, including individuals from the Office of Research and Development (ORD) and program and regional offices involved with the science or engineering proposed. All other applications are automatically declined.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;Those applicants who received final scores of highly recommend or recommend as a result of the peer review process will be asked to provide additional information for the programmatic review pertaining to the proposed PIs &quot;Past Performance and Reporting History.&quot; The applicant must provide the EPA Project Officer with information on the proposed PI&#039;s past performance and reporting history under prior Federal agency assistance agreements (assistance agreements include grants and cooperative agreements but not contracts) in terms of: (i) the level of success in managing and completing each agreement, and (ii) history of meeting the reporting requirements under each agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;This information is required only for the proposed PI&#039;s performance under Federal assistance agreements initiated within the last three years that were similar in size and scope to the proposed project.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;The specific information required for each agreement is shown below, and must be provided within one week of EPA&#039;s request. A maximum of three pages will be permitted for the response; excess pages will not be reviewed. Note: If no relevant prior past performance information and/or reporting history exists, you will be asked to so state.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;ol class=&quot;mode-decimal&quot; type=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Name of Granting Agency.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Grant/Cooperative agreement number.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Grant/Cooperative agreement title.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Brief description of the grant/cooperative agreement.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;A description of how the agreement is similar in size and scope to the proposed project and whether or not it was successfully managed and completed; if not successfully managed and completed, provide an explanation.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Information relating to the proposed PI&#039;s past performance in reporting on progress towards achieving the expected results (outputs/outcomes) under the agreement and meeting reporting requirements under the agreement. Include the history of submitting timely progress/final technical reports, describe how progress towards achieving the expected results was reported/documented, and if such progress was not being made, provide an explanation of whether, and how, this was reported.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Total (all years) grant/cooperative agreement dollar value.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Project period.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Technical contact (project officer), telephone number, and Email address (if available).&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the programmatic review is to ensure an integrated research portfolio for the Agency and help determine which applications to recommend for award. In conducting the programmatic review, the EPA will consider information provided by the applicant and may consider information from other sources, including prior and current grantors and agency files.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;The internal programmatic review panel will assess the following [criteria are listed in descending order of importance (i.e., Criteria a. has the heaviest weight)]:&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;ol class=&quot;mode-lower-alpha&quot; type=&quot;a&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;Relevance of Proposed Research to EPA Research Priorities&lt;br /&gt;
					Research priorities can be reviewed in EPA’s &lt;a href=&quot;/planandbudget/strategicplan&quot;&gt;FY2014-2018 Strategic Plan&lt;/a&gt; which details how EPA plans to progress towards fulfilling its mission of protecting human health and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;Past Performance&lt;br /&gt;
					One aspect of the internal programmatic review is an evaluation of the PI’s past performance under Federal agency assistance agreements (assistance agreements include grants and cooperative agreements but not contracts) initiated within the last three years that were similar in size and scope to the proposed project in two areas: First, in successfully managing and completing these prior Federal assistance projects, including whether there is a satisfactory explanation for any lack of success. Second, in meeting reporting requirements under the prior agreements and reporting progress toward achieving results (outputs/outcomes) under these agreements, including the proposed PI&#039;s history of submitting timely progress/final technical reports that adequately describe the progress toward achieving the expected results under the agreements. Any explanation of why progress toward achieving the results was not made will also be considered. Applicants whose proposed PI has no relevant past performance and/or reporting history, or for whom this information is not available, will be evaluated neither favorably nor unfavorably on these elements.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;P2_Process&quot; name=&quot;P2_Process&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;B. Review Process for Phase II Applications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol class=&quot;mode-decimal&quot; type=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;External Peer Review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		It is expected that Phase II projects/designs will be evaluated in accordance with the process and criteria described below. Phase II applicants will be notified if any changes are made to the review process or criteria. All Phase II projects/designs will be evaluated by external technical peer reviewers made up of non-EPA scientists, engineers, social scientists, economists and/or other professionals who are accomplished in their respective disciplines and proficient in the technical subjects they are evaluating. All Phase I teams will submit a written Project Report which will summarize their Phase I activities and include their proposed Phase II activities. All Phase II projects/designs are reviewed by appropriate external technical peer reviewers based on the criteria and process described below.
		&lt;p&gt;Prior to the external technical peer review panel meeting, all reviewers will receive electronic copies of all applications, as well as a full set of abstracts for the applications. Each application will be assigned to a minimum of three primary peer reviewers, one of whom will be assigned the role of Rapporteur. Each reviewer will be assigned up to approximately 10 applications on which to serve as a primary reviewer. During the review period leading up to the panel meeting, primary reviewers will read the full set of abstracts and entire application package for each application they are assigned. They will also prepare a written individual evaluation for each assigned application that addresses the peer review criteria described below and rate the application with a score of excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the panel meeting, each primary reviewer will report their ratings for the applications they reviewed. Those applications receiving at least two ratings of very good or one rating of excellent from among the primary reviewers will then be further discussed by the panel in terms of the peer review criteria below. In addition, if there is one very good rating among the primary reviewers of an application, the primary reviewer, whose initial rating is the very good, may request discussion of the application by the peer review panel. All other applications will be declined for further consideration.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;After the discussion of an application by the panel, the primary reviewers may revise their initial ratings; and if they do so this will also be documented. The final ratings of the primary reviewers will then be translated by EPA into the final peer review score (excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor) for the application. This is reflected in a peer review results document developed by the Rapporteur, which combines the individual initial and final evaluations of the primary reviewers and captures any substantive comments from the panel discussion. This score will be used to determine which applications undergo the internal programmatic review discussed below. A peer review results document is also developed for applications that are not discussed. However this document is a consolidation of the individual primary reviewer initial evaluations, with an average of the scores assigned by the primary reviewers.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Criteria for External Review of Phase II Grant Awards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			The external technical peer reviewers will base their evaluations of the written Project Report on the criteria below. Each of the four criteria categories are equally weighted.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;ol class=&quot;mode-lower-alpha&quot; type=&quot;a&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proposal Quality&lt;/strong&gt; (the subcriteria identified within this criteria are essentially equally weighted) – The degree to which the application includes a plan for scientifically sound, feasible and appropriate research; challenges and seeks to shift current research or engineering paradigms by using innovative theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation or interventions; clearly expresses its innovative aspects (supported by a literature review where appropriate); lists clear, achievable goals and objectives; identifies and suitably engages end users; and describes any partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overall Sustainability&lt;/strong&gt; (the subcriteria identified within this criteria are essentially equally weighted) – The degree to which the proposed research embodies the principles of sustainability and offers sustainable solutions that protect the environment and strengthen communities; demonstrates how its environmental and economic outcomes will benefit the intended users and/or society; and describes its potential for implementation, adoption, transferability and long-term viability. (The &lt;a href=&quot;/sites/production/files/2015-05/documents/sustainability_primer_v9.pdf&quot;&gt;Sustainability Primer (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;fileinfo&quot;&gt;(2 pp, 195 K)&lt;/span&gt; describes sustainability concepts in more detail.)&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education and Teamwork&lt;/strong&gt; (the subcriteria identified within this criteria are essentially equally weighted) – The degree to which the project serves as a sustainability teaching tool; is appropriate for an interdisciplinary student team (graduate and undergraduate, as needed); and includes a Phase II transition plan.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Budget and Project Management&lt;/strong&gt; (the subcriteria identified within this criteria are essentially equally weighted) - The degree to which the application provides a reasonable and appropriate budget and includes approaches, procedures, and controls for ensuring timely and efficient expenditure of awarded grant funds; adequately describes expertise, facilities and other resources; provides a schedule with milestones for ensuring successful achievement of project objectives; and describes how outputs and social, economic and environmental outcomes will be tracked and measured.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Programmatic Review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			Applications receiving final peer review scores of Excellent or Very Good will then undergo an internal programmatic review, as described below, conducted by technical experts from the EPA, including individuals from the Office of Research and Development (ORD) and program and regional offices involved with the science or engineering proposed. All other applications are automatically declined.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;The internal programmatic review panel will assess:&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;ol class=&quot;mode-lower-alpha&quot; type=&quot;a&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;Relevance of Proposed Research to EPA Research Priorities&lt;br /&gt;

	Phase I applications being considered for funding after the Programmatic Review that involve human subjects research studies will have their HSRS reviewed prior to award. The local EPA Human Subjects Officer (HSO) will review the information provided in the HSRS and the Research Plan to determine if the ethical treatment of human subjects is described in a manner appropriate for the project to move forward. The HSO may consult with the EPA Human Subjects Research Review Official (HSRRO) as appropriate. The HSRRO may determine that an application cannot be funded if it is inconsistent with EPA’s regulations at 40 CFR Part 26.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phase II applications being considered for funding after the Programmatic Review that involve human subjects research studies will have their HSRS reviewed prior to award.

In addition, grant applicants must agree to comply with EPA’s procedures for oversight of the recipient’s compliance with 40 CFR Part 26, as given in EPA Order 1000.17A (Policy and Procedures on Protection of Human Research Subjects in EPA Conducted or Supported Research). As per this Order, no human subject may be involved in any research conducted under this assistance agreement, including recruitment, until the research has been approved or determined to be exempt by the EPA Human Subjects Research Review Official (HSRRO) after review of the approval or exemption determination of the Institutional Review Board(s) (IRB(s)) with jurisdiction over the research under 40 CFR Part 26. Following the initial approvals indicated above, the recipient must, as part of the annual report(s), provide evidence of continuing review and approval of the research by the IRB(s) with jurisdiction, as required by 40 CFR 26.109(e).&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Access and Information Release:&lt;/strong&gt; After award, all data first produced under the award must be made available to the NCER Project Officer without restriction and be accompanied by comprehensive metadata documentation adequate for specialists and non-specialists alike to be able to understand how and where the data were obtained and to evaluate the quality of the data. If requested, the data products and their metadata must be provided to the NCER Project Officer in a standard exchange format no later than the due date of the grant&#039;s final report or the publication of the data product&#039;s associated results, whichever comes first.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;Congress, through OMB, has instructed each federal agency to implement Information Quality Guidelines designed to &quot;provide policy and procedural guidance...for ensuring and maximizing the quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of information, including statistical information, disseminated by Federal agencies.&quot; The EPA&#039;s implementation may be found at &lt;a href=&quot;/quality/guidelines-ensuring-and-maximizing-quality-objectivity-utility-and-integrity-information&quot;&gt;Guidelines for Ensuring and Maximizing the Quality, Objectivity, Utility and Integrity of Information Disseminated by the Environmental Protection Agency&lt;/a&gt;. These procedures may apply to data generated by grant recipients if those data are disseminated as described in the Guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;

In addition, the recipient should notify the NCER Project Officer of any papers published after completion of the grant that were based on research supported by the grant. NCER posts references to all publications resulting from a grant on EPA’s &lt;a href=&quot;/research-grants&quot;&gt;Research Grants website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
