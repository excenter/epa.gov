    <description>&lt;p&gt;UNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In accordance with Section 309(g)(4)(A) of the Clean Water Act (“CWA”), 33 U.S.C. § 1319(g)(4)(A), and 40 C.F.R. § 22.45 of the Consolidated Rules of Practice Governing the Administrative Assessment of Civil Penalties and the Revocation/Termination or Suspension of Permits (“Consolidated Rules”), the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) is providing notice of a proposed Administrative Penalty Assessment against the Village of Pender, Nebraska Wastewater Treatment Facility (“Respondent”) for alleged violations of Sections 301 and/or 404 of the Clean Water Act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under Section 309(g) of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. § 1319(g), the EPA is authorized to issue orders assessing civil penalties for various violations of the Clean Water Act.  The EPA may issue such orders after filing a Complaint commencing either a Class I or Class II penalty proceeding.  The EPA provides notice of the proposed assessment of a Class II civil penalty pursuant to 33 U.S.C. § 1319(g)(4)(A).  Class II proceedings are conducted under EPA’s Consolidated Rules, 40 C.F.R.

&lt;p&gt;In this case, the EPA alleges that Respondent violated terms of its National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit issued pursuant to Section 402 of the Act, including unauthorized discharges, failure to monitor, failure to comply with effluent limits, and failure to properly maintain and operate the facility.  Respondent has reached agreement with EPA on the terms of a proposed Consent Agreement/Final Order which would resolve this matter.  Under the proposed Consent Agreement/Final Order, Respondent will pay a civil penalty of $13,900.  Respondent will pay $7,900 in cash, and the remainder of the civil penalty will be mitigated through performance by Respondent of a Supplemental Environmental Project.  The Supplemental Environmental Project requires Respondent to spend $6,000 to replace incandescent street lights with LED bulbs.  Final approval of the proposed Consent Agreement/Final Order is subject to the requirements of 40 C.F.R. § 22.45.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EPA will receive written comments on the proposed Administrative Penalty Assessment for a period of thirty (30) days from the date of publication of this notice.  All such comments shall be submitted to the Regional Hearing Clerk at the address provided below.  The procedures by which the public may submit written comments on a proposed Class II order or participate in a Class II proceeding, and the procedures by which a respondent may request a hearing, are set forth in the Consolidated Rules.  Persons wishing to obtain additional information on the proceeding, receive a copy of EPA’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2003-title40-vol1/pdf/CFR-2003-title40-vol1.pdf&quot;&gt;Consolidated Rules&lt;/a&gt;, review the proposed Consent Agreement/Final Order, comment upon the proposed penalty assessment, or otherwise participate in the proceeding should contact the Kathy Robinson, Regional Hearing Clerk, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 7, 11201 Renner Blvd, Lenexa, KS 66219.  Please reference Docket No. CWA-07-2017-0004.  In order to provide opportunity for public comment, EPA will issue no final order assessing a penalty in this proceeding prior to forty (40) days from the date of this notice.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Region 7 States Air Quality Monitoring Plans - Nebraska</title>
    <link>https://www.epa.gov/ne/region-7-states-air-quality-monitoring-plans-nebraska</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, and Nebraska; Annual Monitoring Network Plans, Five-Year Monitoring Network Assessments, and approval documentation. Each year, states are required to submit an annual monitoring network plan to EPA. The network plans provide for the creation and maintenance of monitoring stations, in accordance with EPA monitoring requirements specified in 40 CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) Part 58.  For Five Year Monitoring Network Assessments, as stated at 40 CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) Part 58, each state is required to perform and submit to EPA an assessment of its air quality monitoring network every five years. At a minimum, this “five-year assessment” is meant to determine: if the existing network meets the monitoring objectives defined in Appendix D of 40 CFR Part 58; whether new sites are needed; whether existing sites are no longer needed and can be terminated; and whether new technologies are appropriate for incorporation into the ambient air monitoring network. For PM2.5 (particulate &amp;lt; 2.5 micrometers), the assessment also must identify needed changes to population-oriented sites. The first five-year assessment was due to EPA by July 1, 2010, and each assessment thereafter will be due in five-year increments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In accordance with Section 309(g)(4)(A) of the Clean Water Act (“CWA”), 33 U.S.C. § 1319(g)(4)(A), and 40 C.F.R. § 22.45 of the Consolidated Rules of Practice Governing the Administrative Assessment of Civil Penalties, Issuance of Compliance or Corrective Action Orders, and the Revocation, Termination or Suspension of Permits (“Consolidated Rules”), the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) is providing notice of a proposed Administrative Penalty Assessment against the Sioux City Foundry Company, an industry located at 2400 G Street, South Sioux City, Nebraska, for alleged violations of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. § 1319(g) for discharges from the facility into the Missouri River.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under Section 309(g) of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. § 1319(g), the EPA is authorized to issue orders assessing civil penalties for various violations of the Clean Water Act.  The EPA may issue such orders after filing a Complaint commencing either a Class I or Class II penalty proceeding.  The EPA provides notice of the proposed assessment of a Class II civil penalty pursuant to 33 U.S.C. § 1319(g)(4)(A).  Class II proceedings are conducted under EPA’s Consolidated Rules, 40 C.F.R.

&lt;p&gt;In this case, the EPA alleges that the Sioux City Foundry Company violated Section 301(a) of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. § 1311(a) for unauthorized discharges of pollutants into the Missouri River.  Respondent has reached agreement with EPA on the terms of a proposed Consent Agreement/Final Order which would resolve this matter.  Under the proposed Consent Agreement/Final Order, Respondent will pay a civil penalty of $61,000.  Respondent will pay $20,000 in cash, and the remainder of the civil penalty will be mitigated through performance by Respondent of a Supplemental Environmental Project.  The Supplemental Environmental Project requires Respondent to spend $41,000 to replace the standard facility light fixtures with energy-efficient, light-emitting diodes (LED) at its facility, located at 2400 G Street, South Sioux City, Nebraska.  The Respondent anticipates the project will secure significant environmental protection and improvements.  Final approval of the proposed Consent Agreement/Final Order is subject to the requirements of 40 C.F.R. § 22.45.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EPA will receive written comments on the proposed Administrative Penalty Assessment for a period of thirty (30) days from the date of publication of this notice.  All such comments shall be submitted to the Regional Hearing Clerk at the address provided below.  The procedures by which the public may submit written comments on a proposed Class II order or participate in a Class II proceeding, and the procedures by which a respondent may request a hearing, are set forth in the Consolidated Rules.  Persons wishing to obtain additional information on the proceeding, receive a copy of EPA’s Consolidated Rules, review the proposed Consent Agreement/Final Order, comment upon the proposed penalty assessment, or otherwise participate in the proceeding should contact Regional Hearing Clerk, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 7, 11201 Renner Boulevard, Lenexa, Kansas, 66219.  Please reference Docket No. CWA-07-2016-0083.  In order to provide opportunity for public comment, EPA will issue no final order assessing a penalty in this proceeding prior to forty (40) days from the date of this notice.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FACT SHEET: Consent Order for Soil and Groundwater Remedy Implementation, BNSF Hobson Yard Facility, Lincoln, Lancaster County, Nebraska, October 2015</title>
    <link>https://www.epa.gov/ne/fact-sheet-consent-order-soil-and-groundwater-remedy-implementation-bnsf-hobson-yard-facility</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region 7 invites the public to review and comment on the Consent Order for implementation of soil and groundwater corrective action remedies for the BNSF Hobson Yard Facility (Hobson Yard, EPA ID# NED000822767), located at 801 West O Street, Lincoln, Lancaster County, Nebraska. Soil and groundwater contamination still exist onsite at concentrations above risk-based cleanup levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Consent Order requires BNSF to treat and monitor contaminated soil and groundwater on and around the site to remedial action objectives, to restrict access to the property, to limit site use to industrial use only, and to prevent use of and exposure to contaminated soil and groundwater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The public comment period runs &lt;strong&gt;Sept. 28 to Oct. 27, 2015&lt;/strong&gt;, to enable the public to comment on the Consent Order. Written comments should be mailed or emailed to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ruby Crysler&lt;br /&gt;
	EPA Region 7 (AWMD/WRAP)&lt;br /&gt;
	11201 Renner Boulevard&lt;br /&gt;
	Lenexa, Kansas 66219&lt;br /&gt;
	Email: &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:crysler.ruby@epa.gov&quot;&gt;crysler.ruby@epa.gov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comments should be received no later than &lt;strong&gt;Oct. 27, 2015&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comments received will be summarized in a Response to Comments, and responses will be provided to those individuals providing the comments. The Response to Comments will be drafted at the conclusion of the public comment period and incorporated into the Administrative Record. EPA may modify the Consent Order based upon new information and comments from the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A public hearing has not been scheduled at this time. EPA will conduct a public hearing, and receive both oral and written comments, if the public requests a hearing in writing. The written request must state the nature of the issues to be raised at the hearing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BACKGROUND&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hobson Yard is located at 801 West O Street in Lincoln, Nebraska, and encompasses the northeast portion (approximately 100 acres) of the entire BNSF property. Hobson Yard was originally developed as a freight yard and steam engine terminal by the Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy Railroad in 1906. Freight trains were assembled and steam engines serviced and fueled in the yard. The old steam locomotives were replaced by diesel switch engines beginning in the 1940s. In 1956, about 95 percent of Burlington’s operations were converted to diesel. Burlington Northern Railroad came into existence when the Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy merged with the Great Northern and Northern Pacific in 1970. The facility continues to be used for car switching, storage, repair, diesel engine maintenance, and diesel engine fueling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1992, EPA conducted a compliance inspection that included sampling of sludges within the Filled Lagoon. Several chlorinated solvents were detected at concentrations exceeding EPA’s Toxicity Characteristic Levels. The source of the chlorinated solvents in the sludge is believed to be the historic industrial wastewater discharges to the lagoon system. In 1993, BNSF detected a dense non-aqueous phase liquid in a site-monitoring well located near a 20,000-gallon aboveground storage tank formerly used to store chlorinated solvents (PCE Tank Area). Ongoing groundwater monitoring has revealed widespread groundwater contamination that appears to be sourced from both the contaminated soils and sludges within the Filled Lagoon and the contaminated soils in the area of the former PCE storage tank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As directed by the 1994 Consent Order, BNSF implemented interim measures in the Former PCE Tank Area and in the Filled Lagoon Area to attempt to reduce contamination in these source areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following contaminants have been detected in soil: chlorinated volatile organic compounds and dense non-aqueous phase liquid. In groundwater, chlorinated volatile organic compounds are present at concentrations exceeding remedial action objectives for on-site groundwater and drinking water standards for off-site groundwater. Chlorinated volatile organic compounds have also been detected in surface water and sediment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CONSENT ORDER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Consent Order requires the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the PCE Tank Area:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Implement in situ chemical reduction in the source area to reduce contaminant concentrations&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Establish institutional controls (ICs) to limit or control land use to prevent unacceptable exposure&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Implement monitored natural attenuation (MNA) to verify that natural processes are reducing contaminant mass and preventing further contaminant migration&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Operate and maintain a system of groundwater monitoring wells to verify that the remedies are preventing contaminant migration and reducing contaminant concentrations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the South Filled Lagoon Area:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Install a funnel and gate system to intercept and divert contaminated groundwater into a permeable reactive barrier gate&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Establish ICs to limit or control land use to prevent unacceptable exposure&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Implement MNA to verify that natural degradation processes are reducing contaminant mass and preventing further migration&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Operate and maintain a system of groundwater monitoring wells to verify that the funnel and gate system and MNA are controlling contaminant migration and reducing contaminant concentrations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Diesel Storage Tank Area:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Install a system of light non-aqueous phase liquid (LNAPL) recovery wells to passively recover LNAPL&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Establish ICs to limit or control land use to prevent unacceptable exposure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FOR MORE INFORMATION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
