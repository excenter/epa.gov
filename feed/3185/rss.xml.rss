    <title>Photos of Lakes Before and After Algal Blooms</title>
    <link>https://www.epa.gov/nutrientpollution/photos-lakes-and-after-algal-blooms</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Nutrient pollution from a variety of sources can turn waters green with algae. Algal blooms hurt wildlife, spoil recreation, and can be toxic to people and animals. The photos below show lakes and ponds around the country that have been affected by algal blooms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Yorkers and tourists love Harlem Meer for catch-and-release fishing and waterside strolling, but summertime algal blooms can kill off the fish and cause a stink that drives people away. Wildlife like herons and turtles are also harmed by these blooms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lake Hodges is a reservoir in southern California used for drinking water and irrigation as well as recreation like fishing, boating and hiking. Algal blooms here have not only spoiled outdoor activities but at times have caused local utilities to stop drawing water until the algae clears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lake Erie is the warmest and shallowest of the Great Lakes, which makes it susceptible to algal blooms. It is also a source of tap water to the region. In 2014, a toxic algal bloom in the lake&#039;s western basin forced Toledo, Ohio, to issue an advisory to over half a million people, telling them to avoid all contact with their tap water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shelburne Pond is just 10 miles from Burlington, Vermont, and is used for fishing, boating and hiking. Excess nutrients in the pond cause algal blooms that deter people from enjoying this scenic waterbody.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oneida Lake is a popular vacation spot in New York. Toxic algal blooms, which can cause skin and eye irritation to people and kill dogs, have closed beaches here to swimmers and boaters, disrupting tourism and hurting local businesses. Some years, beaches on Oneida Lake have been closed for all but just a handful of days due to algal blooms.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Farmer Story: Keeping the Creek on the Family Farm Flowing and Clean Makes Good Environmental and Financial Sense</title>
    <link>https://www.epa.gov/nutrientpollution/farmer-story-keeping-creek-family-farm-flowing-and-clean-makes-good-environmental</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;David Schroeder farms about 1,200 acres of soybeans and corn around Coon Rapids, Iowa. He first started using no-till techniques in the mid-1980s. In 2013, he was named an Iowa Farm Environmental Leader by the state of Iowa.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/nutrientpollution/farmer-heroes-manage-nutrients-farm&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;See all farmer heroes&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span id=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/nutrientpollution/farmer-story-central-illinois-farmer-manages-nitrogen-use-lower-costs-maintain&quot;&gt;See the next story&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brushy Creek runs through my farm. When I was growing up, I loved cooling off in Brushy Creek. It was fun. The water was fresh. We’d splash around and try to catch fish with a little net.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We never had much time for vacations when I was young. School might be over for the summer, but chores never were. So we didn’t go on many trips. But that was okay because we loved the farm. And we had our creek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;As I grew older and started taking over the farming operations from my dad, I realized it really wasn’t just our creek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I grew older and started taking over the farming operations from my dad, I realized it really wasn’t just our creek. Any soil or nutrients that washed off our land went into the creek and downstream. Our family farm in Coon Rapids, Iowa, also is close to Beaver Creek and a branch of the Raccoon River, so we know our land can affect our neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I’m farming nearly 1,200 acres of soybeans and corn with one of my sons. I want to be a good steward because I want my children to enjoy the area with their families for a long time to come. Besides, being a good steward saves money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, we never knowingly hurt our land, but in the mid-1980s, I noticed erosion and washouts. So I started reading about no-till farming and asking around. Most people saw it as something strange 30 years ago, but I knew we had to change or risk hurting our farm, our profits, and our future. I just figured that if you don’t try new things, you won’t get new gains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to save money and save our soils. The local county agricultural office was offering $4 an acre to those who tried no-till farming on 40 acres, and I was happy to sign up. We left the ground alone after a harvest and planted our next crop of corn into the remnants of a soybean crop. It worked out well, so we tried to do more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After consulting with the Natural Resources Conservation Service, the Farm Service Agency and continuing to read agricultural publications and talk to other farmers, we’ve figured out how to use no-till techniques on about 720 acres. We’ve been planting winter cover crops such as rye and a tillage radish plant that puts down expanding roots, which breaks up compacted soil. That means better water absorption, less runoff and less need to till.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No-till saves me about $12-$15 an acre in fuel costs and hundreds of hours of labor because, it eliminates two trips out to the fields. On 720 acres, I can save nearly $11,000 in fuel alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;On 720 acres, I can save nearly $11,000 in fuel alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also decided to plant only grass on steep hills. Cultivating some of those slopes would be time consuming and likely cause runoff and erosion. We have buffer strips around the creeks, so that natural vegetation remains intact, stabilizing the banks and absorbing any nitrogen runoff before it hits the creek. I still have to use some manufactured fertilizers, but I’ve sent samples of our growing plants off to agriculture labs to see what they need and to ensure we don’t use more fertilizer than necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaving fields unplowed over the winter and allowing cover crops to decay there doesn’t always make for the prettiest sight. I rent some land for farming and a property owner told me he didn’t like what he saw. It wasn’t manicured. Nevertheless, he came to appreciate and approve of the way our no-till techniques preserved his land. I always liked the title of an article I once read called: “Farm Ugly.” Some fields may look more like the rough on a golf course than the grass on the putting greens, but the results save soil, water and money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve also cleaned out our runoff waterways and laid plastic tiling underground to control drainage. And we’ve put in a bioreactor. It sounds futuristic, but it’s essentially a large underground filter made of wood chips. The wood chips absorb excess nutrients from the water, so we don’t harm our creek or our neighbors downstream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We played in Brushy Creek a lot when I was a boy. And my boys liked going down there, too. I always planned to pass this land on to my children. So I want to protect it the best I can and keep it viable for them down the line.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Farmer Story: What I’ve Learned About Protecting the Privilege of Farming </title>
    <link>https://www.epa.gov/nutrientpollution/farmer-story-what-ive-learned-about-protecting-privilege-farming</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom Geake and his father, John, farm about 1,100 acres of corn and soybean near Wall Lake, Iowa and finish 15,000 hogs yearly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/nutrientpollution/farmer-heroes-manage-nutrients-farm&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;See all farmer heroes&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span id=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/nutrientpollution/farmer-story-keeping-creek-family-farm-flowing-and-clean-makes-good-environmental&quot;&gt;See the next story&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I grew up on a farm, studied agriculture in college and am the beneficiary of the wisdom handed down by the previous four generations of my family who farmed our area. Still, I keep discovering new ways to help keep our land productive for current crops and protected for future generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I come from a strong conservation background.  My grandfather already implemented soil saving practices like grassed waterways, terraces, and no-till before I was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been mindful of soil erosion for several decades, but we didn’t think very much about water conservation until a few years back when we saw algal blooms in our farm pond. This prompted us to make several changes. For instance, along with soybeans and corn, we raise hogs, so we’ve found a way to recycle the waste. We now inject manure below the surface of the soil to fertilize the fields and prevent the nitrogen-rich product from washing down the hills. And we test nutrient levels in the manure we use and in the tissue of the plants we grow. We don’t want to use more nitrogen or phosphorous than necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have created about 42 acres of buffer strips around our pond and creeks. We miss out on about 4,000 bushels of crops by not planting those areas. Yes, we might have made more money that way, but by keeping soil and nutrients out of our water supplies, we positively impact wildlife and downstream water users.  We understand that our farming methods can affect many other residents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pullquote&quot; id=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;As a fifth-generation farmer, I want to ensure that I leave our water and land in great condition so future generations continue to feel honored to farm here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Farming the land is a privilege. It’s not a right. We want our next generations to enjoy that privilege. We want to continue to feed the world. However, we never want to hurt the land; we want to build productivity. Here in Sac County, we’ve been fortunate to have some helpful partners, including the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) – a part of USDA. Their programs have provided guidance and cost sharing for some of the measures we take to protect soil and water. Since farming is always evolving, so is conservation.  We are starting to use adaptive nitrogen management and nitrogen stabilizers that keep fertilizer from attaching to the water. Along with other farmers, we are starting to use rye as a cover crop during the cold months. It protects against wind, rain and snow-related erosion. It’s nice to see the fields covered during times they might otherwise be bare and watch local wildlife snack on the plants. The rye draws up any excess nitrogen, stabilizes the soil and then turns into natural fertilizer itself when left in fields to decay.  It acts similarly to the way the native prairies did by recycling nutrients and kicking soil microbe activity into high gear to build healthy soil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These techniques have allowed us to increase our use of no-till methods of planting, which is good for several reasons, including increasing the organic matter in the soil. That allows us to use less fertilizer while still raising great crops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As businesspeople, we applaud that. As farmers, we think it’s great to see our ground living nearly all year long and know we’re helping to preserve the privilege of farming.&lt;/p&gt;

    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chuck Uphoff and his wife, Deb, operate Uphoff Dairy on their century-old, 500-acre family farm near New Munich, Minn. Uphoff also is chairman of the Stearns County Soil &amp;amp; Water Conservation District.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/nutrientpollution/farmer-heroes-manage-nutrients-farm&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;See all farmer heroes&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span id=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/nutrientpollution/farmer-story-clean-water-key-my-familys-farming-future&quot;&gt;See the next story&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love to watch the little creek that flows through our century-old family farm. My father and grandfather enjoyed the creek when they were young and I hope my grandchildren will, too. However, because of soil erosion and nutrient runoff, there was a time when I wondered if my dream was dying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve learned that the pleasant stream passing below our home eventually drains into the Sauk River, which, in turn, empties into the Mississippi River.  My message to other farmers is do not wait until soil erosion and nutrient runoff become a problem for you and those downstream. Do something now to strengthen your business, stabilize your land, and prevent nitrogen and phosphorus runoff from affecting folks downstream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pullquote&quot; id=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Do something now to strengthen your business, stabilize your land, and prevent nitrogen and phosphorus runoff from affecting folks downstream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember the day several years ago when I realized that portions of the hillside on my family’s 500-acre dairy farm were washing down to the stream. It was an unsettling sight because I viewed my land near New Munich as the rock-solid foundation on which I had built our family’s future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As if runoff gullies were not upsetting enough, I also noticed more frequent algal blooms in the creek below. I knew that I had more to worry about than just milk production from our herd. Commercial fertilizer from our fields and animal waste from our feedlot were running down the hills, along with chunks of pastureland. It was hurting us, our stream and, potentially, our neighbors. My wife, Deb, and I knew we had to move quickly to save our livelihood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found help from members of Stearns County Soil &amp;amp; Water Conservation District. Following their advice, I started contouring the hills to slow down storm runoff and hold in water. We put grass buffers around the creek for the same reason. We also built a manure storage area to capture the runoff from the 120 head of cattle that use the feedlot. With that, we prevented 600,000 gallons of waste from reaching the stream each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I changed our plowing methods, too. Instead of turning the ground over to prepare it for alfalfa and oats, we now leave remnants of the most recent crop on the ground to protect our land from wind, rain, and snow. The decaying vegetation also naturally fertilizes the soil. Indeed, we produce excellent crops of hay on fields that I haven’t tilled for several years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pullquote&quot; id=&quot;quote2&quot;&gt;It’s not just good stewardship. It’s good business. Each time soil washed down the hill, the dollars spent on seed and commercial fertilizer went with it. We found ourselves losing ground both physically and financially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, today, we save money by fertilizing our fields with the manure that collects in the well-engineered storage pit. Not only has this stopped all runoff from the feedlot, but I haven’t purchased commercial fertilizer since 1994.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also take samples of the soil and the manure to analyze levels of nitrogen and other nutrients to figure out exactly how much manure we need to apply to the fields. These methods have improved our profitability by at least 10 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After seeing the benefits, I became active with the Stearns County Soil &amp;amp; Water Conservation District and am now the chairman. We’ve been fortunate to have some federal funding to assist 20 to 25 farmers a year with the design, construction, and financing of manure pits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides helping to protect our waterways, those federal dollars will circulate several times through our local economy. And I’ve learned some other interesting facts as well. For instance, streams like the one on my farm are part of a larger system that provides water for countless numbers of people who rely on public drinking water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all have a stake in keeping water and soil safe for the future, even if the potential payoffs still seem a long way off. It’s like when you plant a tree on the farm. You’re not just doing it for yourself; you’re doing it for your grandchildren – and their grandchildren.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Farmer Story: Farmer Discovers How to Protect his Water and Increase his Bottom-line</title>
    <link>https://www.epa.gov/nutrientpollution/farmer-story-farmer-discovers-how-protect-his-water-and-increase-his-bottom-line</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jeremy Prater operates Cedar Creek Farm in Cedarville, Ark., along with his wife, parents and grandparents. Collectively, Prater’s family has been farming for over 100 years and recently purchased their current 230-acre plot of farmland.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/nutrientpollution/farmer-heroes-manage-nutrients-farm&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;See all farmer heroes&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span id=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/nutrientpollution/farmer-story-why-what-happens-little-creek-my-farm-matters-downstream&quot;&gt;See the next story&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I stopped using both fertilizers and pesticides on our 230-acre Cedar Creek Farm in 2007, and our livestock, pastures and water are better for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so are our profits. They’ve been increasing at a rate of about 10 percent in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My choice to eliminate fertilizer and pesticide inputs in my farming operations may make me sound to some like a wide-eyed newbie farmer, who dabbles in dreamy ideals. Let me assure that I’m not. My family has been farming for 100 years and I’m in this to turn a profit. And so are my wife, parents and grandparents, who all help operate the farm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, my grandfather, for one, would never approve a crazy scheme that could risk our farm. He and my grandmother worked too hard – and still do. His own father was a struggling sharecropper in Texas. So when my grandfather and grandmother had an opportunity to buy farmland in Arkansas more than 50 years ago, they did so with the idea that maintaining good land and clean water would ensure the family’s future. My parents feel the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pullquote&quot; id=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;When I tell you that eliminating the applications of fertilizer and pesticides saves money and protects our well water, ponds, pastures and cattle, I mean business. Good profitable business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I tell you that eliminating the applications of fertilizer and pesticides saves money and protects our well water, ponds, pastures and cattle, I mean business. Good profitable business. Moreover, here’s another bonus: the time we save not spraying and fertilizing goes into expanding our production of goats, hogs and free-range poultry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these operations depend on keeping our water supplies clean. Clean-up and filtration of contaminated water could easily double our expenses overnight. Not long ago, runoff from large poultry operations near our farm in Cedarville, Ark., caused algal blooms that started to choke the life out of our local waterways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phenomenon reminded people that, yes, we all must be aware of the downstream effects of our actions. It reinforced our family’s motivation to prevent the heavy phosphorus and nitrogen loads that come from fertilizer runoff.  The only fertilizer we now use is manure and compost, applied only during the winter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we quit spraying the weeds, we discovered that nature’s processes quickly filled in the gap – earthworms returned to aerate the soil and more bats and birds arrived to eat the insects. We established no-mow buffer strips around pastures and ponds to absorb rainfall and runoff. Those areas filter pollutants and help capture more water for our fields and ponds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rotating our cattle through different parts of the pasture very frequently lessens the chances of them picking up parasites when grazing. We have not had to worm our cattle in several years – which I say with confidence, since we do test them. With better pasturelands – thanks in part to our clean water management – we have converted our beef herd into 100 percent grass-fed cows – no grain supplements, steroids or routine antibiotics. They do get all the vaccinations required by law and medicine for the occasional illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of our methods I developed with the help of my soil scientist-wife, agricultural agents and information I found in pre-1940s books about farming methods– back when people used less fertilizer and pesticide. Folks had raised cattle on pastures for a long, long time before chemical treatments existed. We can now, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, our neighbors are noticing the difference on our farm and asking questions. Some initially thought we were taking too large a risk. During a recent drought, however, as they went to buy hay to feed their animals, they noticed how our fields remained green and our ponds still had fish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Farmers are very independent-minded, and change for us doesn’t happen right away. However, the real sales point here is that actions that preserve clean water also allow you to eliminate many costs and increase your bottom line. This is what gets a farmer’s attention. Along with better profits comes the security of knowing that these efforts help preserve family farms through the generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the arrival of my daughter, we now have four generations living on the farm. She’s still a toddler and fascinated by the pigs. No doubt, if she wants to run the farm one day, she’ll have even better methods at her disposal. But one thing won’t change: if she wants to preserve the family tradition, she’ll need clean water. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Farmer Story: Little Rock Farmer Helps Minimize Fertilizer Runoff by Cultivating Interest in Organic Locally Grown Foods </title>
    <link>https://www.epa.gov/nutrientpollution/farmer-story-little-rock-farmer-helps-minimize-fertilizer-runoff-cultivating</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Robert Lashley and his wife, Peg, operate Willow Springs Market Garden in Little Rock. In operation for seven years, Willow Springs raises and sells lettuce, cabbage, radishes, apples, tomatoes and blueberries for the growing number of families and restaurants that prefer crops fed with natural fertilizers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/nutrientpollution/farmer-heroes-manage-nutrients-farm&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;See all farmer heroes&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span id=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/nutrientpollution/farmer-story-farmer-discovers-how-protect-his-water-and-increase-his-bottom-line&quot;&gt;See the next story&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m practical. I use organic farming methods as much as possible to help protect our waterways by minimizing phosphorus and nitrogen runoff. These methods help preserve the clean water in my well and in my neighbors’ wells. I also believe organic farming practices provide a strong selling point to a growing number of consumers who seek locally grown foods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pullquote&quot; id=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;I know that farmers cannot change their fertilization procedures overnight. But I do know that consumers are noticing us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not sanctimonious about it. I know that farmers cannot change their fertilization procedures overnight. I’m also a small-scale, specialty-crop farmer, so my operation might be beneath the notice of the big outfits. But I do know that consumers are noticing us. Increasingly, they want produce grown without heavy doses of synthetic manufactured high-phosphorus fertilizers and pesticides. Indeed, many farmers, on any scale, would go out of business if they found their water choked with algal blooms from runoff of phosphorus or other chemicals. The cost of trucking in water or employing extensive filtration would be prohibitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My wife, Peg, and I have been running Willow Springs Market Garden in Little Rock, Arkansas for seven years. We raise and sell lettuce, cabbage, radishes, apples, tomatoes and blueberries for families and restaurants that want crops fed with natural fertilizers. We use homemade compost and horse manure from local stables, as well as blood meal, bone meal and alfalfa meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was growing up in England, my father was an organic farmer – although he didn’t know it. He worked on a large farm and grew a big vegetable patch to help feed our family. He couldn’t afford to buy synthetic manufactured fertilizer, so he composted to save money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent 40 years working as a registered nurse, but I always felt a tug to one day get back to raising crops. When I did, I was tickled to think that my father and I were employing similar methods, some 50 years apart. We were surprised and delighted when the organizers of the largest flower and garden show in this area reached out and invited us to their event last year.  The show draws about 12,000 attendees and apparently, many had asked the organizers to add exhibits from local farmers who use organic methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had numerous inquiries from backyard gardeners who wanted advice on how to do the same. We told them that we also plant barrier crops around our vegetables to help filter potential runoff and to trap more rainwater in the ground. We even use an organic soap spray as a pesticide to avoid utilizing/applying harsh chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said, I’m practical. I know one small farm or one backyard vegetable patch by itself won’t protect our clean water. However, as these practices spread and consumer demand continues, the environmental and economic benefits will continue to become more visible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My wife and I like to think that it’s best to work with nature rather than fight it. There’s too much at stake to lose.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Farmer Story: For Long Island Farmers, Fertilizer is Key to Saving Money, Reducing Work, and Protecting Community </title>
    <link>https://www.epa.gov/nutrientpollution/farmer-story-long-island-farmers-fertilizer-key-saving-money-reducing-work-and</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom Wickham is the owner and operator of Wickham’s Fruit Farm located in Cutchogue, a rural hamlet on Long Island, New York. This family operation dates back to the 1600s and is identified as a historic and bicentennial farm, one of the oldest continually cultivated farms in the country. He is also a graduate of Cornell, having received his BS, MS, and PhD in Soil and Water Engineering from the university. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/nutrientpollution/farmer-heroes-manage-nutrients-farm&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;See all farmer heroes&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span id=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/nutrientpollution/farmer-story-little-rock-farmer-helps-minimize-fertilizer-runoff-cultivating&quot;&gt;See the next story&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;After working in agriculture all over the world, I can honestly say there’s no place like home. My family’s Long Island fruit farm has been in operation for over 70 years, and multiple generations have made a living farming off our 200 acres of land. If there’s one lesson my family has learned in our years in this area, it is that working with, not against, this unique landscape can make a farmer’s job easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most Long Island topsoil is very sandy and this land trait often spikes one of our largest costs—fertilizer. But this doesn’t have to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Farmers use fertilizer for three key ingredients—phosphorus, potassium, and nitrogen. Because phosphorus and potassium stick to Long Island soil, farms in this area are rarely devoid of these two nutrients. Nitrogen, however, is an element that local farmers tend to worry about, and many end up wasting time and money ensuring that their crops are not lacking. I used to do the exact same thing until I discovered Cornell Cooperative Extension (CCE) of Suffolk County’s Agricultural Stewardship Program and learned several simple changes I could make to reduce my workload, lower my costs, and improve the way I cared for my land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first was timing. Many local farmers apply additional nitrogen fertilizer in the spring, as insurance against potential leaching and runoff. But I learned that the trick is to apply one-quarter of your fertilizer in spring, the majority in summer, and a third application in the fall, if necessary. This technique prevents wasting large amounts of fertilizer in the spring and helps provide consistent nutrients throughout the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second technique I adopted was the use of controlled release nitrogen fertilizer. In this type of fertilizer, 75 percent of the total nitrogen is controlled release while 25 percent is a blend of conventional fertilizer. When applied, the conventional fertilizer in the blend is available upfront while the controlled release portion is gradually released based on soil temperatures. This ensures that the nitrogen needed for the crop is protected against potential leaching and runoff. Unlike conventional nitrogen fertilizer, you only need to apply the controlled release form once a year at planting, ultimately helping you use less, save more, and reduce the tractor time and effort that you put into split application fertilizing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pullquote&quot; id=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;I learned that there are long-term benefits to using these techniques, particularly for the health of my family and community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the Stewardship Program, I also learned that there are long-term benefits to using these techniques, particularly for the health of my family and community. When we apply too much nitrogen fertilizer, it leaches right through our soil and ends up in our water source—contaminating irrigation and domestic resources and potentially leading to health problems. Because of the way our groundwater moves underground, if one area is contaminated, it can spread and take many years to cleanse the area’s sole source aquifer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incorporating these techniques is something that some other Long Island farmers are also doing with the assistance of CCE’s Agricultural Stewardship Program and similar groups. We’ve all experienced tough times lately, and saving a few bucks or a few hours is always beneficial. What we have here is a unique opportunity to work with our land, improve our operations, and protect the health of our community. For me, these are rare opportunities that we shouldn’t pass up. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Farmer Story: Central Illinois Farmer Manages Nitrogen Use to Lower Costs, Maintain Yields and Leave Land in Good Shape for his Children</title>
    <link>https://www.epa.gov/nutrientpollution/farmer-story-central-illinois-farmer-manages-nitrogen-use-lower-costs-maintain</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doug Martin, his wife, Erin, and his parents, Jeff and Jean, operate Martin Family Farms (www.martinfamilyfarms.org) in Mt. Pulaski, Ill. They have been honored several times for environmentally sound farming with awards that include Upstream Heroes from the Conservation Technology Information Center, the Illinois Corn Growers Environmental Action Award, No-Till Farmer Innovator of the Year, and the 2006 Outstanding American Conservation Award from the Farm Service Agency.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/nutrientpollution/farmer-heroes-manage-nutrients-farm&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;See all farmer heroes&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span id=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/nutrientpollution/farmer-story-long-island-farmers-fertilizer-key-saving-money-reducing-work-and&quot;&gt;See the next story&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I’m driving my combine in the fields or reading about new farming methods at home at the end of a long day or showing my children the places where their father, grandfather, great-grandfather, and even their great-great-great-great-grandfather farmed, I’m also thinking about how best to preserve our agricultural heritage for my family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, I learned the importance of this conservation strategy from my dad, Jeff, who today is my partner in our family’s corn and soybean business that includes about 5,000 acres of Central Illinois farmland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice, our conservation strategy means conserving farmland by continuing to refine the methods that my father initiated. We keep working to manage the amount of nitrogen fertilizer we use and take steps to control runoff. We use strip-till and no-till cultivation to keep the soils healthy and less vulnerable to rain and wind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pullquote&quot; id=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;That&#039;s not just feel-good talk, either. That’s good business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These methods let us reduce the number of times our tractors must pass back-and-forth on the fields we cultivate. Fewer trips along the corn and soybean rows saves fuel, labor and wear-and-tear on machinery. It lowers our costs by about $8 to $10 per acre. With 5,000 acres, the savings add up quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the 1980s, when I was growing up, my father became very concerned as he watched wind and rain start to sweep away some of our prime topsoil. Unchecked, it would threaten our ability to keep our farming tradition alive. And that worried my father as much as it does me today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pullquote&quot; id=&quot;quote2&quot;&gt;When I’m thinking about how to lower our impact on the environment, I’m keeping our seventh generation of farmers in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our roots in this business and this community run deep. Our family has been in the Mount Pulaski area for nine generations and I am a sixth generation farmer. We take our heritage seriously. When I’m thinking about how to lower our impact on the environment, I’m keeping our seventh generation of farmers in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s not just about us here in Central Illinois. We’re part of the Mississippi River Basin that touches 31 states. Farmers have become increasingly aware that we can’t allow excess fertilizer to wash into the runoff and contribute to algae blooms that can choke the life out of our waterways all the way down to the Gulf of Mexico. Soil and water are essential to our business and our heritage, and we want to conserve both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the general public may not know that low-impact tilling and better nitrogen management techniques are gaining more converts, my father and I can see the effect on landowners who had been hesitant to lease their acreage. When they hear about our ecologically responsible practices, it eases concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, no method is perfect for every grower or every field. My father and I still experiment and make adjustments each season, and we network with other farmers to hear about their experiences. We encourage all farmers to learn about and try out these methods. Together, we can safeguard our fields, our finances and the quality of life along our rivers and streams.&lt;/p&gt;
