    <title>School IPM  - Breakfast on the Bus</title>
    <link>https://www.epa.gov/managing-pests-schools/school-ipm-breakfast-bus</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Breakfast offers many benefits for students including improved health, learning, and attendance. Schools are increasingly looking at alternatives to traditional breakfast service to meet the nutritional needs of their students. Each alternative presents unique pest control challenges. Breakfast on the bus i&lt;span

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EPA’s vision is that all of the nation&#039;s students attend schools with integrated pest management (IPM) programs. To achieve this goal, we are gathering the support of national organizations with influence within the school community (administrators, business officials, facility managers, nurses, teachers, and parents) to lend their support to the IPM approach and to spread the IPM message throughout their membership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2015, EPA, with public input, conceived of a School IPM Roundtable in which influential organizations would gather to express their support for IPM as the preferred approach managing pests in schools.  In addition, they would commit to explore actions their organizations could take to promote the uptake of IPM in schools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pagetop&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#main-content&quot;&gt;Top of Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;preparation&quot; name=&quot;preparation&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Preparation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EPA met with potential participants to offer information on IPM, discuss their role in its implementation in schools, and solicit their participation in the Roundtable. The EPA Regional Offices simultaneously engaged the state affiliates of the organizations as they agreed to participate to facilitate local preparedness to amplify Roundtable outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goals of the Roundtable were to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;roomy&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Launch the School IPM Initiative for national organizations who influence school district decision making&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Learn about the participants’ networks and communication channels&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Determine what information and resources the participating organizations would find helpful&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Share information and resources EPA and other participants have on IPM in schools&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Learn from experts about their experiences implementing IPM in schools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;pagetop&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#main-content&quot;&gt;Top of Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;event&quot; name=&quot;event&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Event&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On May 25, 2016, EPA convened 29 representatives of 17 national school, health and pest management associations and federal government agencies in Washington, DC to discuss ideas for implementing a set of principles promoting the adoption of IPM practices in the nation’s schools. A &lt;a href=&quot;/managing-pests-schools/school-ipm-rountable-meeting-summary&quot;&gt;meeting summary&lt;/a&gt; documents the event, captures key discussion and presentation points, and provides links to resources referenced. A blog by EPA Assistant Administrator Jim Jones, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.epa.gov/blog/2016/07/endorsing-a-path-to-healthier-schools/&quot; title=&quot;Endorsing a Path to Healthier Schools&quot;&gt;Endorsing a Path to Healthier Schools&lt;/a&gt;, provides context for the event and highlights its importance to the school community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;pagetop&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#main-content&quot;&gt;Top of Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;principles&quot; name=&quot;principles&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Principles of Agreement and Recommendations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the Roundtable, participants agreed that IPM is a science-based approach to pest management that seeks to control pest problems proactively, avoiding the unnecessary use of and exposure to pesticides while achieving acceptable control of pests indoors and outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants endorsed the following&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/managing-pests-schools/school-integrated-pest-management-initiative&quot;&gt;Principles of School IPM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;roomy&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;We understand that children are uniquely vulnerable to environmental hazards due to their developing systems and greater exposures&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We support and will promote and communicate making sound IPM practices the standard in all schools&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We will encourage implementation of school IPM policies and practices and will encourage our members to routinely re-evaluate and improve their practices, as needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Roundtable also produced a set of recommendations for schools regarding their pest control programs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;roomy&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Assess current pest management practices and recurring pest problems&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Designate and train an appropriate staff person to coordinate IPM activities&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Adopt and implement an &lt;a href=&quot;/managing-pests-schools/integrated-pest-management-tools-resources-support-ipm-implementation#model policy&quot;&gt;IPM policy&lt;/a&gt; or plan to prevent and effectively address pest problems&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Conduct regular inspections and monitoring for pests and pest conducive conditions&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Adopt in-house IPM pest prevention and control practices indoors and outdoors and/or contract with pest management firms to perform IPM services&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Provide IPM education corresponding to the roles of those in the school community&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Visit &lt;a href=&quot;/managing-pests-schools&quot;&gt;epa.gov/managing-pests-schools&lt;/a&gt; for free tools and information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;pagetop&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#main-content&quot;&gt;Top of Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;participants&quot; name=&quot;participants&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Participants&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following groups, representing school administrators, facility managers, teachers, and health professionals, participated in the Roundtable where they endorsed&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/managing-pests-schools/school-integrated-pest-management-initiative&quot;&gt;Principles of School IPM&lt;/a&gt;, committed to, and agreed to actively implement school IPM throughout their memberships over the next three years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;outcomes&quot; name=&quot;outcomes&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Outcomes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2016 School IPM Roundtable brought together disparate groups to pursue a voluntary enterprise that addresses pest problems proactively and reduces unnecessary exposure to pesticides.  These organizations provided their endorsement of a Principles of Agreement on school IPM.  They also committed to disseminate the endorsement, along with information on resources available to support school IPM implementation, to their members and associates. The event included an exchange of ideas on how the participants could track implementation of school IPM as a result of the endorsement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EPA will be working with these organizations in the coming months and years to act upon the ideas and commitments coming out of the Roundtable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;questions_answers&quot; name=&quot;questions_answers&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Questions and Answers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The questions below were posed by the webinar participants. The responses may have been refined by the presenters following the webinar for clarification or to include additional resources.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;General Questions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are these prevention measures being used in other kinds of buildings?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		(Dr. Geiger) Absolutely. We are involved in numerous multi-family low-income housing projects. For example one set of developments with 3,500 units with between 8 to 10,000 people. We have been getting a very enthusiastic response. We are hoping to follow-up next year, once the installation is completed. At that point we plan to do some pest monitoring to see how effective it has been. There are many other situations like that out there where pest prevention by design is sorely needed. There is a lot of interest in it right now.&lt;br /&gt;
		 &lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do architects and builders think of the pest prevention measures?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		(Dr. Geiger) That is a great question, and we don’t completely know the answer. I think they recognize that the need is there. I wonder if there is anything that the NPMA can do in this regard. For example, are there better ways to connect the pest control industry with the building industry? I believe that there is not an on-going two-way communication between these industries. If this communication can be fostered at the Association level, then it can trickle down and you can be each other’s pest prevention partners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		I think the work that we do with the Green Building Council is a first step. We have been working with them to improve their IPM credits. If any of you are familiar with the LEED checklists, they have credits for IPM built in; however, they have not been very strong or specific in the past. They have been improving though, and we are hoping to get something in there more explicitly about pest prevention. We recently worked with a lot of developers and architects on housing and rehabilitation projects, and actually there are quite a few architects who really &quot;get it.&quot; We have had some amazing cooperation with architects while we were just sitting there and describing the problem; whether it was with a cold joint between buildings, or a kitchen cabinet with gaps, or a refuse enclosure, they were sitting there drawing out the solutions as we spoke. So several of the architects that we worked with were extremely enthusiastic about pest prevention. I think that is a good sign. I do not know how that plays out in other locales.  A lot of it is such common sense that I think the architects and contractors realize why we are doing this. In many cases, we have found that it is a matter of communicating these changed practices to their sub-contractors, and changing their habits.&lt;br /&gt;
		 &lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We have problems with flies in kitchens – is there some way to prevent this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			(Dr. Geiger) Well, it depends on the fly. The most common fly in kitchens are fruit flies. Fruit flies can reproduce very quickly on very little food. So the first thing to do is to clean everything you can. Possibly you will find a raisin or a grape, or something else underneath your cupboard or in your trash container. Cleaning out your trash containers and drains is a good place to start. Often that will solve the problem. Once you have done that, though, it will still take a while for the flies to disappear. They will live a few more days, even though you have gotten rid of the source. You can put out sticky traps of various kinds. That might help get rid of them more quickly. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			(Dr. Corrigan) If they are other flies that flutter around, they may be drain flies. Just like the name indicates it&#039;s usually a dirty drain or the dirty edges of the drain component itself. It’s not that they are coming up out of the drain. In many cases, they are breeding in the nooks and crannies of the drain system, or even in wet areas between tiles. So drain flies are often associated with stagnating water getting trapped in micro crevices. In that case, you need to be a detective. The other place that flies are found is in the dumpster, where flies feed on the organic soup that accumulates on the bottom and sides. &lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;If it&#039;s a larger fly, like the house fly, many times the first place to check is right at the dumpster. Just like Dr. Geiger said, check the nooks and crannies both in and outside of the dumpster. Those dumpster areas along with flat crevices, really need to be scrubbed for they are often a major fly breeding zone. Then inspect 20 to 40 feet from the dumpster. Follow their path directly into the kitchen. Look for any unscreened windows or doors. &lt;/p&gt;
		For any additional flies that are still fluttering around, I break out my insect net and run around the kitchen catching them. It actually works quite well. &lt;br /&gt;
		 &lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Are these prevention measures cost effective?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			(Dr. Corrigan) Pest prevention measures are nearly always more cost effective than having to correct a pest infestation once it has become established (and then continues to spread to previously uninfested areas).  With pests, it is nearly always a case of &quot;pay me now, or pay me more later.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;What is the best way to determine where to invest money in my pest prevention and control program? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;(Dr. Geiger) That is a matter of prioritizing pest prevention efforts in an existing building. The first thing you are going to want to pay attention to is the building envelope and any ways that pests can get in from the outdoors. In conjunction with that, a walk-about is a priority. On the inspection, bring along someone who knows their stuff. That will go a long way toward prioritizing how you spend your money. For example, in some cases you might find a rat super highway around or under the building, perhaps leading to the basement. Those pathways could be the root source of all of your problems, but it takes a trained eye to see them. After the building envelope, the next priority is to look at anything that is leading between rooms like pipe chases and so forth, especially if you are working in multifamily residential buildings, because this would allow pests to move from room to room. The next priority would be the kitchen, where the pests have everything they need: Water, harborage, and food. Review some of the situations and practices covered in this presentation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			(Dr. Corrigan) What Dr. Geiger says sums it up exactly. You have to be careful, though. Sometimes the pest problem could be so overwhelming that you must do triage and determine which the most important thing to accomplish first is. This particular webinar reviews many of these steps. Start with the big problem areas first, then work backwards. It is not about sealing every single nook and cranny at first, but to prioritizing the most important ones. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;What can I do about rats in outdoor areas? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Review above answer (#4). Do a walkabout. Seal the building envelope, etc. Review the EPA webinar: Keeping Rodents Out of Your School – January 2015. Listen to and view the recorded webinar.  But the most important rule to keep in mind is that if there are rats outdoors, there is food nearby.  If it is Norway rats, it usually is all about the trash; or someone’s trash very close to the area.  If the rats are roof rats, they can be a bit more difficult because they can feed on fruit trees, nuts, berries and the like.  For sure eliminate the easy sources first.  Make sure there are no bird feeders until the rats are corrected.  Any fruit trees must be managed to avoid leaving any fruits on the ground.  Check to make sure neighborhing dog pens are not contributing.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Isn&#039;t 1/4 inch mesh susceptible to mouse entry? * It&#039;s confusing that the presentation indicates in a couple of places that a 1/4 inch gap allows mouse entry.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			(Dr. Corrigan) If it is ¼ inch mesh, really, a mouse cannot negotiate it, particularly since it is in a square. Sometimes they can negotiate a ¼ inch crevice at the base of a door, but in most cases, ¼ inch mesh gets the job done quite well.  In general, it is a matter of how we express it.  Anything larger than a ¼ inch is asking for trouble; sometimes it is better to think in terms of the metrics system.  Nothing larger than 6 mm is usually recommendation for mice and nothing larger than 12 mm for rats.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please provide details on how to identify correct sealant products. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			(Dr. Corrigan) I’d like to make a comment first. There is a big difference between caulk and sealant. That is very important for people to realize. When you buy caulk, that is one type of chemistry, and when you purchase sealants, that is another chemistry. The distinction is that sealants give and take when a joint moves. You need elasticity, meaning that the sealant will continue to move without creating a gap. Caulks perform relatively poorly in this regard. It is very important that you do your homework on elastomeric sealants, and that is easily done on the internet. There you can see the difference in elasticity between brands. The better ones are worth every single penny. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Any suggestions to keep roaches out of computers in the classroom? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			(Dr. Corrigan) First, no food should be allowed in a computer room that might attract and feed the cockroaches.  If roaches are established within computers, it is because they have food nearby the computers.  Sticky monitoring traps can be set at the back exterior of the computers; and cockroach bait stations can also be installed either nearby (but in out of sight areas) or even within the computer encasements by pest professionals familiar with such practices.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Any ideas on how to catch a roof rat?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			Please review our webinar on: &lt;a href=&quot;/managing-pests-schools/previous-webinars-about-integrated-pest-management-schools#Jan2015&quot;&gt;Keeping Rodents Out of Your School – January 2015&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQgyPhLDP2s&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&quot;&gt;Listen to and view the recorded webinar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;exit-disclaimer&quot; href=&quot;/home/exit-epa&quot; title=&quot;EPA&#039;s External Link Disclaimer&quot;&gt;Exit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			(Dr. Corrigan) Roof rats can be tricky to catch. It is not a DIY job for many reasons including personal safety.  Again, ask why is the roof rat there?  Identify the food source and if possible eliminate the food.  Inspect for structural disrepairs and have these corrected.  Once the roof rat is stressed from losing its food source, snap traps are probably the best approach.  Install several traps in the areas of activity; place an enticing small amount of food on and around the trap without setting the trap.  Do this for a 3-5 days before actually setting the trap.  Once the rat has taken the pre-set baits for a day or two, then go ahead and set the traps in the capture position.  Capturing roof rats with traps is a job left to a pest professional who is experienced in this practice.  &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do trash compactors have advantages over dumpsters? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			(Dr. Corrigan) Of course, they will hold larger quantities of trash.  However, the tradeoff is they must be carefully maintained and kept clean at all times. If they become grungy or the various components do not close properly due to accumulating residues, they can quickly become pest breeding centers for flies, bees and wasps, as well serving as a constant attractant to these pests and others such as birds, raccoons, rodents, ants and cockroaches. Dumpsters must also be kept clean, lids kept closed and they must be stationed away from delivery doors and on concrete pads.  Otherwise dumpsters will also serve as pest magnets to the building and possibly fly breeding centers (particularly below the dumpster in any crevices in which food residues leak and accumulate. Many schools “live and die” with their pest issues all due to how they maintain or fail to maintain their dumpsters and compactors.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Every once in a while we get a call about a bat that gets into one of the schools (probably from an unscreened window left open overnight). Any proven ideas how to catch them without harming them? Maybe a butterfly net?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			(Dr. Anderson) Please review page 8 of the EPA PESP Wire on bats: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www3.epa.gov/pestwise/news/pesp/pespwire-2013-11.pdf&quot;&gt;https://www3.epa.gov/pestwise/news/pesp/pespwire-2013-11.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;fileinfo&quot;&gt;(14 pp, 3.9 MB, &lt;a href=&quot;/home/pdf-files&quot;&gt;About PDF&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; or the following EPA blogs on bats: &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.epa.gov/blog/2012/10/bats-more-than-tiny-city-vampires/&quot;&gt;Bats: More than tiny city vampires&lt;/a&gt;, 10/31/12 and &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.epa.gov/blog/2016/03/management-of-much-maligned-often-misunderstood-bats/&quot;&gt;Management of Much Maligned, Often /Misunderstood Bats&lt;/a&gt;, March 8, 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Comment) I found durabond a fast setting plaster over stainless blockage at pipe penetration. Very hard and great to keep rodents from getting through. A very long-lasting combination at significant pipe penetrations. Also over mesh, screening properly applied at heater pipe penetrations. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			(Dr. Corrigan) Sounds like a good suggestion. As long as it is also of sufficient elastomericness.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have a checklist that can be followed or use for IPM when new construction for schools and child care are being planned?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			(Dr. Geiger) The guideline is not divided up by kind of building. The EPA certainly has a lot of resources on school IPM. I am not sure what you have in the way of checklists. The Department of Pesticide Regulation in California has a &lt;a href=&quot;http://apps.cdpr.ca.gov/schoolipm/&quot;&gt;school IPM program&lt;/a&gt; which has a lot of materials as well. With regard to our checklists, we do have ones that correspond to the pest prevention guidelines that we can make available. I can share those with EPA. They are all a work in progress, but they are a very helpful tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			There is also a coalition called the Scientific Coalition on Pest Exclusion. The acronym is the same as the mouthwash: SCOPE. This coalition is a group of scientists and other professionals from both private and public sectors. Finding the scientific basis for pest prevention is their top priority, and they are developing research checklists as part of that.  Some of these checklists will probably be site specific for schools, distribution centers, homes, office buildings, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there any industry standard language (link?) to include in commercial (institutional) new or renovation design documents? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			(Dr. Geiger) We have some &lt;a href=&quot;http://sfenvironment.org/article/business/integrated-pest-management-for-multifamily-housing&quot;&gt;documents&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;exit-disclaimer&quot; href=&quot;/home/exit-epa&quot; title=&quot;EPA&#039;s External Link Disclaimer&quot;&gt;Exit&lt;/a&gt; with specification language that we have been using in our projects with low-income housing. This language was used in the design documents, and is was oriented around sealants. It did not address everything you would probably want to address but it was a great start and I would be happy to share that. The EPA does have a document under the &lt;a href=&quot;/children&quot;&gt;Office of Children’s Health Protection website&lt;/a&gt;. Scroll down. You will see a number of resources toward the bottom right of the page. It will talk about the school citing guidelines. EPA put the document out a few years ago, so it may very well prove to be useful in you school building process or for renovation.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will attendees receive a follow-up email with the link for this recorded presentation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			(Dr. Anderson) The link is located on our website and will be sent out via our listserv when it is posted. The &lt;a href=&quot;/managing-pests-schools/join-school-ipm-listserv&quot;&gt;School IPM Listserv&lt;/a&gt; is a great way to motivate those in the school community to start, grow, and sustain their IPM programs.

&lt;h3&gt;General Questions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will the presentation be available for download? Where?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/managing-pests-schools/ipm-turf-pests-school-grounds&quot;&gt;A PDF of the presentation&lt;/a&gt; is available on our website along with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8s7U0uw8Vw&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&quot;&gt;recording of the webinar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;exit-disclaimer&quot; href=&quot;/home/exit-epa&quot; title=&quot;EPA&#039;s External Link Disclaimer&quot;&gt;Exit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Turf Specific Questions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With the belief that the climate is rapidly changing due to pollutants, thus causing an increase in temperatures, do you feel that IPM will eventually be revised?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		(K. Pope) IPM is ever-evolving with new information as it becomes available. It is not a one-size –fits-all set of procedures. It depends on what you are talking about based on the situation that you are dealing with. Pest control is ever-evolving, and when we incorporate an integrated approach it, too, is ever-evolving as new discoveries are made. Everything has got to be open to change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		(A. Kowalewski) One of the things we should consider with climate is that we have two basic types of grass in the United States. We have cool season grasses and warm season grasses. So as things change, we will typically see warm season grasses being pushed farther and farther north across the nation. We have already seen this trend at Purdue University. Their football field now consists of Bermuda grass, which is the farthest north we have seen for the utilization of that warm season grass. So as the climate changes, we will have new grasses in different places and we will probably see pest common to the southeast moving farther north along with the grasses. Things will change, but I do not think that IPM will fundamentally change. The cultural practices that we use are very common across all of the states and the pest management practices are as well. Yes, things may change a little bit, but I do not see any major revisions to IPM. Because we are still going to be managing the same grasses that have already existed in the US.&lt;br /&gt;
		 &lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This a great presentation for the northwest and southern states, but what do you recommend for arid states like AZ, NV, NM and UT, where water resources are scarce?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			(A. Kowalewski) Some very good resources for arid states are at the NM State University, University of AZ, and UT State University. There are some great faculty in these institutions that do a lot of research with arid environments. Some of the things you should think about in these areas is the use of reclaimed water and gray water. This is actually required in several arid states and advancements in research is ever-continuing. That is developing of grasses that are tolerant of high levels of salt content. People are continually developing warm season grasses, Bermuda grasses, and Zoystra grasses, that can tolerate higher and higher salt content levels for irrigation with effluent water. In arid areas like that, think about using these grasses and using effluent water resources to minimize the use of potable water on the landscape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			(K. Pope) I agree with what Alec said. I have worked out in AZ and have seen first-hand what he says about water conservation and newly developed tolerant grasses.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In CT, we can only use organic material for European Chafer. Do you have any information on products that we can use?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			(A. Kowalewski) With the European chafer and Japanese beetle, and you see the same thing with the European crane fly in the Pacific Northwest. Because of the lack of insecticide options, primary cultural practices are going to be the best way to manage the grass. There are some things like milky-spore and other products that can provide some results, but typically the biologicals will not provide you with the quick response that we see from a synthetic pesticide. So particularly with regard to primary cultural practices, irrigation is going to be the big tool when managing grass infected with European chafer, European crane fly or Japanese beetle. If I remember correctly, I believe that the European chafer do not prefer to lay their eggs in irrigated turf grass. They like drier grass conditions. So if you irrigate the grass at ¼ inch, three times per week, it will improve rooting and provide conditions that are not conducive to the European chafer when it is laying eggs.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We have a new soccer field that we planted last fall. When do we need to fertilize?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			(A. Kowalewski) The timing for fertilization depends on whether you have warm season grass or cool season grass. With cool season grasses, a real easy way to remember when to fertilize is by utilizing the &#039;holiday fertilization plan.&#039; Fertilize on Memorial Day, 4th of July, Labor Day, and Halloween or Thanksgiving. Four to five times per year, twice in the spring and two or three times in the fall. If you are dealing with warm season grasses, start fertilizing in the spring, but avoid the late fall application: Memorial Day, 4th of July and Labor Day. As things begin to cool down, stop fertilizing warn season grasses. So if you have just established sod in the fall, it would be a good idea to fertilize twice this spring. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do pH samples normally cost to obtain and about how much would that be?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			(K. Pope) If you do regular soil sampling it will cost you between $7 and $15.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		

		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Many states now have laws restricting the use of pesticides on school grounds. There is some evidence that aerification can help to manage white grubs. Are there any cultural practices you have come across to deal with a grub population that exceeds threshold levels?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			(K. Pope) Unfortunately, there is not much that you can do for cultural control practices on grubs. Really the only thing that I know to do is replace heavily damaged turf areas and moisture management is something to keep in mind. Egg production can increase in areas where you have a high soil moisture in the turf area and dryer soil conditions in the surrounding areas. &lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;(A. Kowalewski) To improve turfgrass tolerance to white grubs increase the mowing height, be sure to fertilize 4 times a year at a minimum to generate vigorous turfgrass growth and irrigate in the summer months.  Adjusting irrigation levels prior to infection typically has little effect because European chafer prefer to lay eggs in dry soil, while Japanese beetle prefer moist soil.  Considering this irrigate 1.0 to 1.5” per week in the summer months.  Heavily infested turfgrass will require light and frequent irrigation, daily at 0.2 to 0.25 inches, to keep the turf alive while the grubs are active.  Turf with excessive infestations will succumb to grubs despite frequent irrigation and should be re-seed or re-sodded.  Milky spore has long been marketed as a bio-control agent for white grubs; however, research on this product has produced variable results, and school laws may restrict the application of even bio-control agents.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
