    <title>Fact Sheet Spring 1998: Human Health Evaluation and Ecological Risk Assessment Regarding PCB Contamination in Pittsfield, MA</title>
    <link>https://www.epa.gov/ge-housatonic/fact-sheet-spring-1998-human-health-evaluation-and-ecological-risk-assessment</link>
    <description>&lt;h2&gt;SUMMARY&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency&#039;s New England Office recently completed risk evaluations on human health and ecological impacts on a two-mile section of the Housatonic River. The two evaluations document the widespread prevalence and high concentrations of PCBs in and along the two-mile section of river and the significant human health and environmental risks from exposure to those PCBs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the findings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Young children and teenagers playing in and near portions of the river face noncancer risks that are 200 times greater than EPA considers safe. Noncancer effects from PCBs may include liver and nervous system damage and development abnormalities, including lower IQs.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Teenagers growing up near portions of the river face a 1 in 1,000 cancer risk due to exposure to contaminated riverbank soils.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Fish collected in the river had PCBs concentrations of up to 206 parts per million, among the highest levels ever found in the United States and 100 times higher than the limits set by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;91 of 93 sediments samples taken in the Upper Reach of the river showed the presence of PCBs.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;These risk evaluations, which were peer reviewed and endorsed by EPA Headquarters, support EPA&#039;s position that the entire two-mile section of river may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to human health and the environment. These evaluations justify removal actions for the Upper Reach section of the river. The actions also are based on data showing that previously cleaned-up floodplain areas are being recontaminated by PCBs from the river during routine flooding.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HUMAN HEALTH RISK EVALUATION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;The Human Health Risk Evaluation, co-authored by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection, examined cancer and noncancer risks to humans based on PCB contamination levels in river sediments, riverbank soils and backyard soils as well as consumption of fish caught in the river.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;The risk evaluation focused primarily on health risks from short-term PCB exposures - less than 10 years of exposure. The study assumed exposure to PCB-contaminated sediments and soils when residents were walking, playing and sitting in and alongside the river. The exposure is primarily through skin contact with PCB-contaminated soil and sediments, and incidental ingestion of dust.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;The health risk evaluation concludes that there are significant human health risk along the entire two-mile stretch of river. Some of the highest human health risks are in the lower 1½ miles of the Upper Reach. This is due both to high PCB levels in this area- average PCB levels in shallow river sediments, for example, are nearly five times higher downstream than in the first ½-mile section - and higher exposure rates since portions of the lower section of river are more residential and more accessible than the top ½-mile section.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;Among the highlights in the human health risk evaluation:&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;Noncancer Risks - Potential Effects such as Reproductive and Development Abnormalities (such as Lower IQs), Liver Damage and Adverse Impacts on Nervous Systems&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Young children playing for just one summer in the river in portions of the lower section - specifically, a ½-mile area between the Elm Street and Dawes Avenue Bridges - face noncancer risks 200 times higher than the hazard-index level EPA considers safe. This estimated risk assumes exposure to PCB-contaminated surface sediments in the river. PCB levels in this area averaged 89 parts per million, nearly five times higher than the 19 ppm average in the top ½ mile section between Newell and Lyman Streets.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Children, ages 5 to 12, who live or play alongside the river between the Elm Street and Dawes Avenue Bridges face noncancer risks 90 times higher than the hazard-index level EPA considers safe. This estimated risk assumes springtime and summertime exposure to PCB-contaminated riverbank soils and floodplain soils.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Teenagers who live or play alongside the river face noncancer risks 200 times higher than hazard-index level EPA considers safe. This estimated risk assumes springtime and summertime exposure to PCB-contaminated soils while walking and playing on the riverbanks in the vicinity of the GE plant between the Newell Street and Elm Street Bridges.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;A nine-year-old child who consumes one meal of fish from the Housatonic River each week for just one summer faces noncancer risks about 900 times higher than the hazard-index EPA considers safe.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;Cancer Risks&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Some sections of the two-mile stretch of river pose an increased cancer risk beyond levels that EPA considers acceptable. As an example, teenagers who grow up alongside the river - in the vicinity of the Newell Street and Elm Street Bridges - face a 1 in a 1,000 cancer risk due to their exposure to contaminated riverbanks soils.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/01/10818&quot;&gt;Evaluation of Human Health Risks from Exposure to Elevated Levels of PCBs in Housatonic River Sediment, Bank Soils and Floodplain Soils in Reaches 1-2 to 4-6 (Newell Street to the confluence of the East and West Branches), May 14, 1998 (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;fileinfo&quot;&gt;(58 pp, 3.1 MB, &lt;a href=&quot;/webguide/pdf-files&quot;&gt;about PDF&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ECOLOGICAL RISK ASSESSMENT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;The Ecological Risk Assessment evaluated the environmental impacts PCBs are having on water quality and aquatic species along the two-mile Upper Reach section of the river. The assessment was based on recent surface water, sediments and fish data collected by GE, EPA and the U.S. Geological Survey.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Of 93 sediment samples taken from the two-mile section of river, 91 showed the presence of PCBs, with the highest concentrations being 905 parts per million. Sixty-two of the 93 samples had PCB concentrations that would cause severe impacts on most aquatic species.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Fish collected in the river had PCB concentrations of up to 206 parts per million. Based upon effects observed in other scientific studies, the ecological assessment concludes that the PCB levels would have adverse reproductive impacts on fish and on animals that rely heavily on fish in their diet such as heron and otter.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The EPA&#039;s Ambient Water Quality Criteria (AWQC) for PCBs in the middle part of the two-mile river section was exceeded in nine out of 10 months during a recent sampling period in 1996 and 1997.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>EPA Summary of Agreement: General Electric/Pittsfield - Housatonic River Site</title>
    <link>https://www.epa.gov/ge-housatonic/epa-summary-agreement-general-electricpittsfield-housatonic-river-site</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;On October 7, 1999, representatives of U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; U.S. Department of Justice; the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection, Office of the Attorney General and Executive Office of Environmental Affairs; the State of Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection and Office of the Attorney General; the U.S. Department of Interior; the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; the City of Pittsfield; the Pittsfield Economic Development Authority and the General Electric Company (GE) reached a comprehensive agreement relating to the cleanup of GE&#039;s Pittsfield facility, certain off-site properties and the Housatonic River.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The detailed terms of this agreement are incorporated in a Consent Decree which was lodged on October 7, 1999, with the United States District Court of Massachusetts, Western Division, located in Springfield, Massachusetts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Consent Decree provides for cleanup of the Housatonic River and associated areas, cleanup of the General Electric Plant facility, environmental restoration of the Housatonic River, compensation for natural resource damages, and government recovery of past and future response costs. In addition, a Definitive Economic Development Agreement among GE, the City of Pittsfield, and the Pittsfield Economic Development Authority (PEDA) provides for economic redevelopment of the GE Plant facility. That agreement will become effective upon entry of the Consent Decree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The major components of the combined agreements are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol start=&quot;1&quot; type=&quot;I&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cleanup of Contaminated Areas&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Restoration of Natural Resources&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Recovery of Government Costs&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Effect and Form of the Consent Decree&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional important actions include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enhanced Public Participation&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Brownfields Redevelopment and Economic Aid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below is EPA&#039;s summary of the Consent Decree. It should be noted that this is EPA&#039;s summary and has not been approved by the other parties to the agreement. In addition, this summary is not intended to be all-inclusive or binding in any respect, and is being provided for public informational purposes only. The Consent Decree and other ancillary documents represent the final, binding agreement between the parties and are being made available to the public at the following locations:&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A public comment period of 60 days will begin when the notice is published in the federal register.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;I. Cleanup of Contaminated Areas&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A. Scope of the Consent Decree&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This agreement covers the GE Plant Site, including Silver Lake and Unkamet Brook, the former oxbows (including Newell Street commercial properties), the Housatonic River sediments, banks, and floodplain properties downstream of the GE Plant Site, and the Allendale School. With the exception of the residential properties within the former oxbows, this agreement does not cover cleanup of residential properties in Pittsfield or elsewhere that received GE wastes for use as fill. These properties are covered by a separate Administrative Consent Order between Massachusetts and GE. More than 100 residential fill properties will have been cleaned up by the end of the 1999 construction season. Residential fill properties remain a high priority and will continue on an expedited sampling and cleanup schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B. Overall Principles for Management of the Cleanup&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol type=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Extensive sampling on GE and non-GE owned properties. Agencies to oversee all GE work and reserve the right to conduct additional sampling if necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;GE to perform cleanups except on 1 ½ Mile Reach of Housatonic River. (See section C.8).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Material and debris excavated from areas subject to this Consent Decree, excluding the River below two miles, are to be consolidated on the GE facility subject to the following:
		&lt;ol type=&quot;a&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;No disposal of regulated TSCA waste or RCRA hazardous waste in the Hill 78 Consolidation Area.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;No on-site disposal of drums, capacitors, equipment, free product or asbestos required to be removed as part of the building demolition.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Area and height limitations of the consolidation areas as follows:&lt;br /&gt;
				Hill 78- 5.6 acre footprint and 1,050 foot maximum elevation, Building 71- 4.4 acre footprint and 1,048 foot maximum elevation, Merrill Road/New York Ave- 1.6 acre footprint and 1,027 foot maximum elevation. Elevation is based on National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD). For reference purposes, current elevation of the top of Hill 78 (including the material from the Allendale School, as described in Item I.C.3) is 1049 feet.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Capping and long-term monitoring of consolidation units.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Building demolition debris, following the removal of asbestos, may also be consolidated within the existing foundations of certain buildings.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Environmental Restrictions and Easements (EREs) are to be placed on all GE-owned properties to ensure that current uses will not change (i.e., commercial/industrial properties will continue to be used as commercial/industrial properties and recreational properties will continue to be used as recreational properties) and to protect the integrity of the cleanup.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Two options for non-GE owned properties: a) cleanup that is protective of current use with Environmental Restrictions and Easements (EREs) utilized, with consent of the owner, to maintain current use, or b) a conditional solution which also provides a cleanup that is protective of current use but, instead of EREs, requires additional cleanup if the use of the property changes ( see also C. 2.b).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Fully cooperative approach to management of cleanup activities.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The parties have established a management architecture for project implementation involving EPA, state regulatory agencies, GE, and, as appropriate, PEDA, the City and the Trustees to ensure that all aspects of the project are managed in a fully collaborative and cooperative manner, to plan work and to cooperatively head off problems and disputes before they arise.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Public to provide input throughout implementation of the work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;C. Specific Areas for Cleanup&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol type=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GE Plant Site&lt;/strong&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;GE will undertake the following:&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;ol type=&quot;a&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Soil Remediation
				&lt;p&gt;Objective: to remediate surface soils to levels that allow for commercial/industrial or recreational use, and to minimize exposure to contaminants in deeper soils.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Remediation required for PCBs greater than 25 parts per million (ppm) average in surficial soils (0-1 foot).&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;An engineered barrier to minimize infiltration and prevent exposure will be implemented in areas where PCBs greater than 100 ppm average are within the top 15 feet.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Remediation required for PCBs greater than 200 ppm average from 1-6 feet.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;New or repaired utility corridors will be backfilled with soils that contain no more than 25 ppm PCBs.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;No capping of unpaved soils in floodplain. Soil removal and replacement required instead in order to avoid loss of flood storage capacity.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Removal of pavement in 200-foot-wide buffer zone on northern (plant) side of River between the location of the former Thermal Oxidizer and the downstream boundary of the GE facility to provide enhanced habitat resoration and to reduce storm water runoff.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Future City of Pittsfield ballfield will include a one foot cap in addition to achieving the recreational standard of 15 ppm PCBs average in the next 2 feet.&lt;br /&gt;
						 &lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Unkamet Brook and Floodplain Remediation
				&lt;p&gt;Objective: To provide protection for human recreational users and biological receptors in the portions of the Brook and its floodplain from Dalton Avenue downstream to the Housatonic River.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reroute Unkamet Brook to its former channel and cap entire existing industrial landfill.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Remove Brook sediments and remediate inundated wetland sediments to achieve 1 ppm PCBs average in surface sediments.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Remove soils in Unkamet Brook recreational floodplain to achieve 10 ppm PCBs average in top foot and 15 ppm in 1-3 foot depth.&lt;br /&gt;
						 &lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Hill 78 and Building 71 Consolidation Areas
				&lt;p&gt;Objective: To eliminate risk of exposure to materials in the consolidation units through a combination of engineering controls and long-term monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Install a protective cap over Hill 78 and Building 71 Consolidation Areas.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Establish an extensive groundwater monitoring system to monitor the groundwater surrounding the landfill.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Install a liner and leachate collection system for Building 71 Consolidation Area.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Design both areas with human health and environmental protection, as well as configuration limitations, in mind.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;An additional area at New York Ave/Merrill Road may be utilized and will be designed in a similar manner to the Building 71 Consolidation Area.&lt;br /&gt;
						 &lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Non-GE Owned Property Within the GE Plant Site
				&lt;p&gt;Objective: To make properties safe for current use through a combination of clean-up and deed restrictions (with appropriate compensation to the property owner); and to provide flexibility (in the form of additional cleanup) for future use changes on properties where there is not agreement on deed restrictions. The property owner will decide which option to choose. Both options provide an initial cleanup that is protective of current uses.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;For current commercial/industrial and recreational areas, GE is to make best efforts, as defined in the Consent Decree, to obtain appropriate deed restrictions (i.e., EREs), including offering reasonable monetary compensation, and will clean up property consistent with the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;either&lt;/strong&gt;: obtain EREs with owner&#039;s consent and clean property as follows:

						&lt;ol start=&quot;1&quot; type=&quot;i&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;at commercial/industrial properties, clean up consistent with GE Plant Site commercial/industrial standards, including remediation (via soil removal and/or pavement enhancement) for PCBs greater than 25 ppm average in surficial soils, achievement of 200 ppm PCB average for 1-6 foot depth, installation of engineered barrier where PCBs exceed 100 ppm average in top 15 feet, and backfilling in new or repaired utility corridors with soil less than 25 ppm PCB average; and&lt;/li&gt;
							&lt;li&gt;at recreational properties, achieve 10 ppm PCB average in top foot of soil and 15 ppm at 1-3 feet, install engineered barrier where PCBs exceed 100 ppm average in top 15 feet, and ensure backfill in new or repaired utility corridors is less than 10 ppm PCBs average;&lt;/li&gt;
						&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;strong&gt;or&lt;/strong&gt;: if the owner&#039;s consent for an ERE is not obtained, GE will implement a conditional solution protective of current use, meeting the following requirements:

						&lt;ol start=&quot;1&quot; type=&quot;i&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;same soil remediation as at properties with EREs except that GE will remove soils to achieve PCB averages of 25 ppm in the top 3 feet at commercial/industrial properties and 10 ppm in the top 3 feet at recreational properties; and&lt;/li&gt;
							&lt;li&gt;GE will conduct further remediation that is needed to be protective of any legally permissible future use for which the owner obtains governmental approval (if necessary) and provides appropriate evidence regarding the future use or activity.&lt;br /&gt;
								 &lt;/li&gt;
						&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Groundwater Remediation
				&lt;p&gt;Objective: to meet appropriate standards for protection of surface waters (i.e., Housatonic River, Silver Lake, Unkamet Brook) and to prevent risks from volatilization of contaminants into occupied buildings. The standards are based on the assumption that there is no current or reasonably foreseeable future use of groundwater for drinking water purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Install perimeter and sentinel (early warning) groundwater monitoring systems.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Continue oil recovery and conduct groundwater treatment until groundwater standards are met.&lt;br /&gt;
						 &lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Timetable:&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Active control of potential sources of contamination to the River has been ongoing for many years and is continuing. Upstream source control has been completed and remaining source control will be completed prior to river excavation in the relevant river reach.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Overall facility cleanup will be coordinated with Brownfields Redevelopment.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Unkamet Brook investigation process will begin 24 months after entry of the Consent Decree. After completion of the investigation, cleanup work will begin.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;All work in these areas is expected to be completed over a period of about 5 years after entry of the Consent Decree.&lt;br /&gt;
						 &lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Former Oxbow Areas&lt;/strong&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;GE will undertake the following:&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;ol type=&quot;a&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Additional sampling of soils and groundwater
				&lt;p&gt;Objective: To identify the nature and extent of soil and groundwater contamination.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Soil Remediation
				&lt;p&gt;Objective: to achieve appropriate cleanup standards keyed to current uses and expected future uses (i.e., commercial, recreational, or residential standards referenced below) and to allow for changes in property uses.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;For the Lyman Street and Newell Street parking lots, remove surficial soils and replace with vegetative engineered barriers.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;For current commercial/industrial and recreational areas, GE to clean-up in accordance with Item C(1)(d) above.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;For residential properties, achieve 2 ppm PCB average.&lt;br /&gt;
						 &lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Continue oil recovery operations and implement groundwater treatment or controls until groundwater standards are met.
				&lt;p&gt;Objective: to prevent floating and sinking oils from discharging to the River.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Timetable:&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;As the cleanup of the Upper Two Mile Reach progresses from the Newell Street Bridge downstream, oxbow property cleanups will be coordinated with River work to the extent practicable. Cleanup of the River will begin at the Newell Street bridge in the Fall of 1999. GE will submit an investigation plan for the Newell Street commercial properties 5 months from the lodging of the Consent Decree. After entry of the Consent Decree and completion of the investigation, cleanup work will begin.&lt;br /&gt;
						 &lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allendale School&lt;/strong&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Objective: to remove contaminated fill (which had previously been capped) from the schoolyard and restore the schoolyard.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;GE removed all soils containing PCBs greater than 2 ppm (except in a small area at depth near the foundation of the school building where concerns over foundation stability and safety only allowed for an average of 2 ppm to be met); GE replaced with clean soil and is restoring area.&lt;br /&gt;
				 &lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Timetable:&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Soil remedial work has been completed and restoration work is on-going. The restoration is expected to be completed in the Fall of 1999.&lt;br /&gt;
				 &lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Housatonic River Floodplain - Current Residential Properties&lt;/strong&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Objective: to clean all properties to unrestricted use standards.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;GE will implement (or share in funding for 1 ½ Mile Reach Riverbanks) the following:&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;ol type=&quot;a&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Residential properties in 1 ½ Mile Reach&lt;br /&gt;
				 
				&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Remove non-riverbank soils to no more than 2 ppm PCBs average.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Riverbanks to be addressed by EPA as part of Engineering Evaluation/Cost Analysis (EE/CA) for 1 ½ Mile Reach (Item C.8 below).&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Timetable: Clean-up coordinated with river work to the extent practicable.&lt;br /&gt;
						 &lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Timetable:&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Investigation process to begin 16 months after entry. After completion of the investigation, cleanup work will begin and will be coordinated with the River work to the extent practicable.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Residential Properties Downstream of 2-Mile Reach&lt;br /&gt;
				 
				&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Remove soils at actual or potential lawn areas to no more than 2 ppm PCBs average.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Install short term measures (e.g., signs) for riverbanks with contamination levels exceeding state thresholds for short-term measures.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Remediate riverbank portions as part of Rest of River (Item C.9 below).&lt;br /&gt;
						 &lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Timetable:&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Investigation process to begin 16 months after entry. After completion of the investigation, cleanup work will begin.&lt;br /&gt;
						 &lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Housatonic River Floodplain - Non-Residential Areas&lt;/strong&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Objective: to achieve appropriate cleanup standards keyed to current uses and expected future uses (i.e., commercial, recreational, or residential standards referenced below) and to allow for changes in property uses.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;GE will undertake (or share in funding for 1 ½ Mile Reach Riverbanks) the following:&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;ol type=&quot;a&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;In 1 ½ Mile Reach, riverbanks are to be remediated by EPA as part of the 1 ½ Mile Reach Removal Action (Item C.8 below).&lt;br /&gt;
				 &lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Recreational and commercial/industrial non-riverbank areas in 1 ½ Mile Reach will be addressed in accordance with Item C.1.d above.&lt;br /&gt;
				 &lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;In area below 1 ½ Mile Reach, address the non-residential floodplain properties in connection with the cleanup of the Rest of River (Item C.9 below).&lt;br /&gt;
				 
				&lt;p&gt;Timetable:&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cleanup of 1 ½ Mile Reach floodplain properties will be performed concurrently with River cleanup to the extent practicable.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Non-residential floodplain properties below 2 miles will be on a timetable that is dependent on the Rest of River decision.&lt;br /&gt;
						 &lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Silver Lake&lt;/strong&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;Objective: to provide a clean-up that is protective of human and ecological use of the lake.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;ol start=&quot;1&quot; type=&quot;a&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Remove bank soils at non-residential properties to achieve no more than 10 ppm PCBs average in top foot and 15 ppm PCBs average at 1-3 feet, assuming EREs are executed. If no ERE&#039;s, a conditional solution will be implemented for bank soils that will achieve 10 ppm PCBs average in top 3 feet and meet the other requirements for conditional solutions in Item C.1.d.(ii) above. On residential properties, GE will achieve a 2 ppm PCBs average.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Remove and replace hot spot sediments near the outfall.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Cap the entire 26 acre lake bottom and armor the entire perimeter of lake; specific design plans to be approved in the future by EPA.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Perform periodic review of effectiveness of cap. If performance standards for cap are not met, additional actions will be evaluated and implemented.&lt;br /&gt;
						 &lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Timetable:&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Investigation process to begin 18 months from entry of the Consent Decree. After completion of the investigation, cleanup work will begin.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Housatonic River - Upper ½ Mile Reach&lt;/strong&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;Objective: to achieve a clean-up that is protective of human health and the environment within the Upper ½ Mile Reach and to prevent further downstream migration of contaminants.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;GE will undertake the following in the Upper ½ Mile Reach (Newell Street Bridge to the Lyman Street Bridge):&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;ol start=&quot;1&quot; type=&quot;a&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Remove and restore sediments per final design work plan already submitted by GE and approved by EPA.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Remove and restore bank soils to achieve 10 ppm average in top foot and 15 ppm average at 1-3 feet.&lt;br /&gt;
						 &lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Timetable:&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;To begin in the Fall of 1999. To be completed by May, 2001.&lt;br /&gt;
						 &lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Housatonic River - Next 1 ½ Mile Reach from the Lyman Street Bridge to the Confluence of the East and West Branches (includes sediments and riverbanks)&lt;/strong&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;Objective: to achieve a clean-up that is protective of human health and the environment within the 1 ½ Mile Reach and to prevent downstream migration of contaminants.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;ol start=&quot;1&quot; type=&quot;a&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;EPA is currently conducting and GE is funding an Engineering Evaluation/Cost Analysis (EE/CA) of the alternatives for cleanup of the 1 ½ Mile Reach.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;EPA will select response actions for the1 ½ Mile Reach after the completion of the EE/CA and after consultation with GE, affected property owners in the 1 ½ Mile Reach floodplain, and the Citizens&#039; Coordinating Council, and review by EPA&#039;s National Remedy Review Board.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;EPA will implement the selected response action. The costs will be shared by GE and EPA with the amount of funding dependent on the overall costs:
						&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;GE to pay 100% of costs up to $15 million.&lt;/li&gt;
							&lt;li&gt;For incremental costs between $15 and $25 million, GE will pay 70% of costs and EPA will pay 30%.&lt;/li&gt;
							&lt;li&gt;For incremental costs between $25 and $32.5 million, GE will pay 60 % of costs and EPA will pay 40%.&lt;/li&gt;
							&lt;li&gt;For incremental costs between $32.5 and $40 million, GE and EPA will each pay 50%.&lt;/li&gt;
							&lt;li&gt;For incremental costs between $40 and $50 million, GE will pay 40% of costs and EPA will pay 60% of the costs.&lt;/li&gt;
							&lt;li&gt;For incremental costs exceeding $50 million, GE will pay 30% of the costs and EPA will pay 70% of the costs.&lt;/li&gt;
						&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Examples of allocations under cost share formula: if cost of response action is $32.5 million, EPA&#039;s cost share will be $6 million, or approximately 20% and GE&#039;s share will be $26.5 million. If the cost is $40 million, EPA&#039;s share will be $9.75 million, or approximately 24 %, and GE&#039;s share will be $30.25 million. If the cost is $50 million, EPA&#039;s share will be $15.75 million, or approximately 31.5%, and GE&#039;s share will be $34.25 million.&lt;br /&gt;
						 &lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Timetable:&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Draft EE/CA to be available to the public in the Fall of the 1999. Work to begin in June 2001 and to be completed in 4 years.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Housatonic River - &#039;Rest of River&#039; -- contaminated river sediments, banks and floodplain areas (other than actual or potential lawns, which are covered in Item I.C.4.b) downstream of the confluence with the West Branch&lt;/strong&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;Objective: 1) Implement a process which is designed to result in a remedy decision for the downstream portions of the Housatonic River that is protective of human health and the environment; and 2) Performance by GE of the Rest of River cleanup.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;ol start=&quot;1&quot; type=&quot;a&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;EPA to conduct additional sampling, human health and ecological risk assessments and modeling.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;A Peer Review Panel will review the human health risk assessment, ecological risk assessment and modeling performed by EPA.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;GE to compile all data into an investigation report and evaluate remedial alternatives under a modified process which limits appeals until after a final remedy has been chosen.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;At conclusion of studies, EPA will issue a Statement of Basis that selects a river remedy and modify GE&#039;s RCRA permit to obligate GE to perform the cleanup.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;GE agrees to perform the selected cleanup after completion of any dispute resolution under Consent Decree:&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dispute resolution may include review by the EPA Environmental Appeals Board and the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;During dispute, all work not subject to the dispute continues, and EPA can proceed with designing aspects of the Rest of River cleanup that GE has disputed, and under certain conditions may proceed with implementation of the work.&lt;br /&gt;
						 &lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Timetable&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Decision on the Rest of River cleanup is expected to be made by EPA in 2002. Based on the assumptions that the clean up of the first two miles of river will not be completed until 2004 or 2005, EPA does not expect any delay in the implementation of the remedy for the Rest of River if GE invokes the dispute resolution referenced above.&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;II. Restoration of Natural Resources&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A. Primary Restoration&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Objective: to compensate the public for natural resource damages by cleaning up valuable resource areas to the extent practicable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Primary restoration will be composed of the response actions agreed upon for the Housatonic River, Silver Lake, Unkamet Brook and associated wetlands and floodplains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B. Compensatory Restoration&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Objective: to compensate the public for natural resource damages that could not be addressed through the clean-up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compensatory restoration will be composed of the following elements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol type=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;GE will pay $15 million, plus interest, to be administered by the natural resource trustees (US Department of Interior, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Commonwealth of Massachusetts, State of Connecticut), with appropriate public input, for natural resource projects.&lt;br /&gt;
		 &lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;GE will perform or fund the following restoration/enhancement activities in connection with the cleanup:
		&lt;ol type=&quot;a&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Habitat enhancements in the first ½ Mile River Reach (enhancement of vegetation on banks) in conjunction with response action performed by GE.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Payment made (as part of cost share) for habitat improvements in the next 1 ½ Mile Reach (pool/riffle structure in riverbed, enhancement of vegetation on banks) in conjunction with response action to be performed by EPA.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Habitat and recreational enhancements at Silver Lake. Additional funding will also be provided for Trustee work on the lake.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Unkamet Brook Area habitat improvement, including rerouting of the brook to its original location and removal of certain nuisance plant species.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;At the GE Plant Site south of East Street, in a 200-foot-wide strip along the river between the location of the former Thermal Oxidizer and the downstream boundary of the GE facility, enhance stormwater drainage and create vegetated buffer by removing the pavement and replacing it with clean soil and vegetation.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Herbaceous native grassland communities will be created at certain GE-owned properties along the Housatonic River and on the GE Plant, including the area described in item e above, the Newell Street Parking Lot, the Lyman Street Parking Lot, and the Hill 78 Consolidation Area.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Floodplain forest/wetland community will be created on approximately 12 acres of riparian land, which will be protected through a conservation easement.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Protection of 10 acres of wetland on GE Plant Site east of Unkamet Brook through a conservation easement.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Payment by GE of $600,000 for wetlands mitigation.&lt;br /&gt;
				 &lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;GE will conduct an assessment of the integrity of Woods Pond Dam and Rising Pond Dam, and implement interim measures needed, if any, to ensure the integrity of these dams.&lt;br /&gt;
		 &lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;GE will coordinate with the Trustees and EPA in the design, implementation and maintenance plans for the restoration/enhancement activities identified in II.B.2.&lt;br /&gt;
		 &lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The Pittsfield Economic Development Authority (PEDA) will pay up to $ 4 milion dollars based on a revenue-sharing arrangement linking the anticipated success of the economic redevelopment in Pittsfield with the additional natural resource damage compensation. The $4 million will be administered by the natural resource trustees, with appropriate public input, for natural resource restoration projects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;III. Recovery of Government Costs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GE and governments have agreed on the amount GE will pay to reimburse response costs previously incurred and to be incurred by the governments in connection with the site. The details regarding the specific reimbursement amounts can found in Section XX of the Consent Decree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;IV. Form and Effect of the Consent Decree&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A. The settlement agreement is in the form of a federal court Consent Decree. The Consent Decree includes, among other provisions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol type=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;EPA review and approval rights on all plans in the Consent Decree.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;EPA ability to modify the scopes of work being implemented by GE under the Consent Decree; (see Paragraph 39 of the Consent Decree)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Periodic review by EPA of the cleanup; (see Section X of the Consent Decree)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Emergency response provision; (see Section XIX of the Consent Decree)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Dispute resolution processes; (see Section XXIV of the Consent Decree)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Stipulated penalties for inadequate or late work by GE; (see Section XXV of the Consent Decree)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Agreements by the governments and GE not to sue each other subject to certain reservations; (see Section XXVI and XXVII of the Consent Decree)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;EPA to have the ability to take over work if GE is not performing adequately, or to order additional work by GE if new information or unknown conditions show the cleanup is not protecting human health or the environment (see Paragraph 178 of the Consent Decree); and&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Protection for GE from certain &#039;contribution&#039; claims by other parties (see Section XXIX of the Consent Decree).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;B. EPA agrees to defer final decision making on listing the Site on the CERCLA National Priorities List (NPL) (see Paragraph 200 of the Consent Decree). EPA may finalize listing the Site, under certain conditions, including if EPA concludes that a situation exists where it needs to take over the cleanup work under the Consent Decree due to inadequate performance by GE, subject to GE&#039;s right to dispute resolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the provisions of the Consent Decree, the following other important components will be implemented at the Site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhanced Public Participation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Objective: to implement this agreement in a manner that considers and utilizes the ideas of the citizens of Berkshire County.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A. A Citizen&#039;s Coordinating Council has been established to serve as a focal point for community participation in the cleanup. The Council includes leaders from Berkshire County&#039;s political, environmental, community, and business sectors. The Council has provided and will continue to provide an important mechanism to ensure that all of the settling parties fully honor their commitment to listen to, learn from, and incorporate the ideas and concerns of the community to the greatest extent possible. The governments intend to submit drafts of major technical documents to the Citizens Coordinating Council for review and discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B. EPA will provide additional outreach to property owners affected by this agreement, including participating in and hosting public meetings, small neighborhood meetings and individual meetings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brownfields Redevelopment And Economic Aid&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Objective- to utilize the former GE facility for new development thus preserving undisturbed &quot;greenfields&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GE, the City of Pittsfield and the Pittsfield Economic Development Authority (PEDA) have entered into the Definitive Economic Development Agreement. Under this agreement, GE will clean up its Plant Site to agreed upon Consent Decree standards (Item I.C.1) , demolish several buildings, provide some funding for building new buildings and transfer portions of the property to PEDA for economic redevelopment. In addition, GE will provide economic aid to the City of Pittsfield for 10 years and make upgrades to the Plant Site and Silver Lake that will have aesthetic value and enhance local habitat.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;h2&gt;Overview of the Silver Lake&lt;/h2&gt;

		&lt;div class=&quot;figure image mode-media_large caption left&quot; style=&quot;width:300px&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Aerial map of the Silver Lake&quot; id=&quot;SilverLakeAerialMap&quot; src=&quot;/sites/production/files/styles/large/public/2015-06/aerial-300-silverlake-locus.jpg&quot; title=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;230&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;figcaption&quot;&gt;Mouseover map for close-up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;colorbox-gallery&quot; href=&quot;/sites/production/files/2015-05/aerial-map-ge.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;colorbox-gallery-1&quot; title=&quot;Aerial map of the GE/Pittsfield Housatonic River Project in Pittsfield, Mass.&quot;&gt;Aerial Map detailing GE Project in Pittsfield, Mass.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;colorbox-gallery&quot; href=&quot;/sites/production/files/2015-05/layout-map-ge.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;colorbox-gallery-1&quot; title=&quot;Layout map of the GE/Pittsfield Housatonic River Project in Pittsfield, Mass.&quot;&gt;Layout Map detailing GE Project in Pittsfield, Mass.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;The Silver Lake Cleanup Area is located directly west of and across from Silver Lake Boulevard and the Former 30s Building Complex Removal Action Area and includes the lake and its banks. It is bounded to the north by Silver Lake Boulevard and Fourth Street, to the east by Silver Lake Boulevard, and to the west and south by residential and commercial properties (covering portions of 21 tax parcels). Silver Lake has a surface area of approximately 26 acres and a maximum water depth of about 30 feet. The lake currently receives stormwater flow from several City outfalls and one NPDES-permitted outfall. The NDPES-permitted outfall receives stormwater from a portion of the GE Plant Area that has been transferred to PEDA. Silver Lake discharges to the east Branch of the Housatonic River through an underground 48-inch diameter, concrete culvert pipe located in the southwest portion of the lake, near the intersection of Fenn and East Streets. This pipe conveys surface water from Silver Lake as well as stormwater runoff from Fenn and East Streets to the Housatonic River.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;Silver Lake has a history of extensive contamination. PCBs had been detected (prior to remediation) in moderate to high amounts in the lake&#039;s sediment, bank soils and surface water. Historic discharges of PCBs and other chemicals in process water and wastewater from GE&#039;s operations have been reported.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;h3&gt;Remediation of the Silver Lake Area&lt;/h3&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;The Consent Decree and the August 2011 Final Removal Design/Removal Action Work Plan for the Silver Lake Area required that GE dredge 400 cubic yards of PCB &quot;hot spot&quot; sediment adjacent to one of the historic GE outfalls, remove additional near-shore sediment around the perimeter of the lake, clean up contaminated bank soil, and place a silty sand-based cap on the entire bottom of the lake. A 2005 bench-scale study and a 2006 one-acre pilot project of capping techniques were conducted to assist in finalizing the design of an effective fourteen-inch thick cap and cap material delivery system.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;Full-scale remediation was initiated in the summer of 2012 and was substantially completed in December 2013. In addition to placement of the sediment cap, this consisted of the removal and off-site disposal of approximately 9,200 cubic yards of bank soil and debris, 400 cubic yards of sediment near a former GE outfall, and 2,900 cubic yards of soil, sediment and debris from the lower bank and near-shore sediment to allow for the placement of the shore-line cap protection system. When accounting for over excavation in these areas and the removal of temporary access road material, a total of approximately 15,815 cubic yards (20,580 tons) of bank soil, sediment, and road material was transported to licensed off-site disposal facilities. The lake&#039;s banks were restored with clean fill and native vegetation, and the sediment throughout the lake was capped with a sand-topsoil mix with a minimum in-place total organic carbon (TOC) content of 0.5%.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;As part of the final bank restoration, a 2,000 foot long walking path was installed along the north and east shores, and over 1,000 native trees and shrubs were planted along with native grasses and wildflowers. In addition, some of the trees that had been cut down to implement the remedy were placed horizontally in shallow water along the shoreline to restore and enhance wildlife habitat (i.e., &quot;woody debris&quot; or structure).&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;In 2014, GE initiated post-removal site control activities, including inspection, monitoring and maintenance activities to verify that the cap is functioning as designed and to ensure other components of the remediation are functioning properly.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;GE submitted a Final Completion Report (FCR) on May 8, 2015, and EPA issued a Certificate of Completion to GE on June 22, 2015. The FCR formalized GE&#039;s inspection, monitoring and maintenance requirements moving forward, with the exception of on-going surface water sampling. GE is performing all Post-Removal Site Control Activities, including inspection, monitoring and maintenance activities as specified in the FCR.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;For surface water, GE committed to a two-year post-cap sampling program consisting of monthly sampling at the outfall pipe to the Housatonic River. This program was implemented throughout 2014 and 2015, and shows significant reductions in the levels of PCBs in lake water compared to such levels prior to remediation. EPA collected split samples during many of these sampling events, and EPA&#039;s and GE&#039;s data is presented in GE’s 2014 and 2015 Annual Monitoring Reports. As of January 2016 GE has committed to continuing this sampling program going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;Documents related to this portion of the cleanup, including annual monitoring reports, are available under the &quot;Reports&quot; tab for the Silver Lake Area.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;h2&gt;Overview of the On-Plant Consolidation Areas&lt;/h2&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hill 78 On-Plant Consolidation Area (OPCA)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			This area encompasses approximately 6 acres and is located within the boundaries of the Hill 78-Remainder RAA. It is located in the northern portion of Hill 78-Remainder Area, and is surrounded on all sides by the Hill78-Remainder RAA, except for the east, where it is bordered by the Building 71 OPCA. The Hill 78 OPCA includes the former Hill 78 landfill, which was a 15-foot tall on-site disposal area that was historically used by GE for excavated soils, building demolition and construction debris, and other materials generated within the GE facility. In 1991, GE installed a temporary cap on the former landfill that consisted of a geotextile layer covered with either one foot of crushed stone or soil.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;This area was designated in the Consent Decree as a consolidation area for certain materials excavated or otherwise removed as part of various Removal Actions and building demolition debris at the GE-Pittsfield/Housatonic River Site. This area received approximately 134,500 cubic yards of materials from 1999 through 2009. (See below for more details on material placement requirements.) The area was filled to capacity and final capping was completed in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;GE submitted a Final Completion Report for the Hill 78 and Building 71 OPCAs on September 15, 2011and EPA issued a Certificate of Completion to GE on September 26, 2011. GE is currently performing all required Post-Removal Site Control Activities, including inspection, monitoring and maintenance activities.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building 71 On-Plant Consolidation Area (OPCA) -&lt;/strong&gt; This approximately 4.4 acre area is also located within the boundaries of the Hill 78- Remainder RAA. It is located immediately to the east of the Hill 78 OPCA. The co-generation facility is located directly to the south. This area was designated in the Consent Decree as a consolidation area for certain materials excavated or otherwise removed as part of various Removal Actions and building demolition activities at the GE-Pittsfield/Housatonic River Site. This area received approximately 110,500 cubic yards of materials from 2001 through 2006. (See below for more details on material placement requirements.) The area was filled to capacity and final capping was completed in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;GE submitted a Final Completion Report for the Hill 78 and Building 71 OPCAs on September 15, 2011and EPA issued a Certificate of Completion to GE on September 26, 2011. GE is currently performing all required Post-Removal Site Control Activities, including inspection, monitoring and maintenance activities.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pre-Construction actions and ancillary areas associated with the Hill 78 and Building 71 On-Plant Consolidation Areas (OPCAs)&lt;/strong&gt; – The construction of the OPCAs was preceded by the demolition of Building 71, the demolition of a structure located along the western side of the Hill 78 OPCA, and the removal and/or abandonment of storm sewers associated with Building 71.  Two stormwater basins were constructed to manage the flow of clean run-off water from the OPCAs.  Approximately 60 cubic yards of soil with elevated PCBs were removed from the northern stormwater basin and placed in the Building 71 OPCA.  Any other disturbed soil was used as backfill or in re-grading activities - no soil was transported off site for disposal. &lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;In addition to the area associated with the placement of materials, the two stormwater basins encompass 1.1 acres and other support areas consist of 0.65 acre.  Thus, the OPCA RAAs cover a total area of approximately 12.15 acres.  &lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hill 78 and Building 71 On-Plant Consolidation Areas (OPCAs) Placement Requirements -&lt;/strong&gt; Certain materials generated during the performance of Removal Actions and building demolition debris were permanently consolidated at these two OPCAs. The materials generally included soils, sediments, and existing surface materials (e.g., asphalt, other debris) that were excavated or otherwise removed as part of the Removal Actions for each RAA and building demolition debris.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;Specifically excluded from consolidation within the OPCAs were free liquids, free product, intact drums and capacitors, and other equipment that contains PCBs within its internal components, as well as asbestos-containing material required by applicable law to be removed from structures prior to demolition.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;Materials consolidated within the Hill 78 OPCA were limited to materials that contained less than 50 ppm PCBs, on average, and were not classified as a hazardous waste under regulations issued pursuant to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). Materials that contained more than 50 ppm PCBs or were classified as a hazardous waste under regulations issued pursuant to RCRA were allowed to be consolidated at the Building 71 OPCA. The Building 71 Consolidation Area was constructed with a bottom liner and a leachate collection system.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;The final cap at both of the OPCAs was a multilayered cap consisting of an impermeable high-density polyethelyne (HDPE) liner, a geosynthetic drainage composite layer, eighteen inches of sand, and six inches of top soil with a vegetative cover.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;h2&gt;Overview of the Housatonic River ½ Mile Removal&lt;/h2&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;The Upper ½-Mile Reach Removal Action, which was completed in September 2002, addressed the contaminated riverbanks and sediments in the East Branch of the Housatonic River from the Newell Street Bridge to the Lyman Street Bridge. The comprehensive Consent Decree for Site cleanup required GE to perform this removal action, under EPA oversight, and to initiate construction activities in October 1999, shortly after lodging of the Consent Decree. (Appendix F to the Consent Decree is the EPA-approved Removal Action Work Plan for this reach of the River.)&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;Sediment and bank excavation was performed in the following manner. Sheetpile was driven in the middle of the river channel and the flow diverted to ½ of the river channel. Sections of the river were then dewatered and the &quot;dry&quot; sediment removed by conventional equipment (e.g., backhoes, cranes, etc.). Restoration of the riverbed included placement of a cap containing a silty sand sorptive layer, covered by an armored layer to return the riverbed to its existing elevation and as a substrate for restoration. Restoration included enhancing, where possible, instream and river bank habitat. During the excavation, non-aqueous phase liquid (&quot;NAPL&quot; or free product) was observed in sediment and in the river bank in several locations. At each of these locations, GE, under EPA oversight, removed the NAPL and NAPL-stained sediment down to a maximum depth of eleven feet, completed further bank soil excavation, and installed additional impermeable sheetpile walls to minimize the NAPL migration from the river bank. As a result of these actions, approximately 11,800 cubic yards of sediment and 6,400 cubic yards of bank soil were removed. The majority of the material was disposed of at the GE On-Plant Consolidation Areas at the GE facility, but sediment containing free product were disposed of at off-site facilities. The ½ Mile reach cleanup was completed in September 2002.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;In addition to the Consent Decree cleanup, EPA had directed cleanup at one heavily-contaminated portion of the Upper ½ Mile Reach prior to the Consent Decree. In December 1996, EPA issued a Unilateral Administrative Order under the Superfund law to GE to remove highly contaminated sediment and bank soil in the area adjacent to GE&#039;s Building 68, which is on the banks of the River in the Upper ½ Mile Reach and was the location of a historic PCB spill. As a result, in 1997 and 1998 GE excavated and disposed of 5,000 cubic yards of heavily contaminated sediment (average PCB concentration of approximately 1,534 parts per million, or &#039;ppm&#039;) from a 550-foot section of the river and 2,230 cubic yards of heavily contaminated bank soil (average concentration of surficial soil of 720 ppm and average concentration of subsurface soil of 5,896 ppm) from a 170-foot stretch of the river bank. Sediment removal activities were performed &quot;in the dry&quot; by installing sheetpile into the river and diverting the flow of the river around the sheetpile, dewatering, and removing the sediment with standard excavating equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;GE is currently performing all required post-removal site control monitoring requirements for the Upper ½-Mile Reach.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;h2&gt;Overview of Groundwater&lt;/h2&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;Groundwater in Pittsfield area of Site generally flows toward, and discharges up into, the East Branch of the Housatonic River, Silver Lake or Unkamet Brook. Groundwater contamination and any associated light non-aqueous phase liquids (LNAPLs) on the surface of the groundwater would typically migrate towards and discharge into these water bodies in the absence of engineering systems designed to contain or remove the contaminated groundwater and LNAPL.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;For administrative purposes, the groundwater at the Site has been segregated into five groundwater management areas (GMAs), as described below.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;GMA 1 - Plant Site 1 including the 20s Complex, 30s Complex, 40s Complex, East Street Area 2-South, East Street Area 2 - North, East Street Area 1 - North, East Street Area 1 - South, Lyman Street Area, Newell Street Area II, Newell Street Area I, and Silver Lake Area.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;GMA 2 - Former Oxbow Areas J and K.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;GMA 3 - Plant Site 2 including the portion of the Unkamet Brook Area east of Plastics Avenue.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;GMA 4 - Plant Site 3 including the Hill 78 Consolidation Area, the Building 71 Consolidation Area, the Hill 78 Area - Remainder, and the portion of the Unkamet Brook Area west of Plastics Avenue.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;GMA 5 - Former Oxbow Areas A and C.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Groundwater Monitoring Program&lt;/h2&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;The overall objectives of the groundwater program at the Site are to ensure that contaminated groundwater and NAPL do not adversely impact surface waters, sediments, and biota, including those in the Housatonic River, Silver Lake, and Unkamet Brook, and also to ensure that contaminants in groundwater do not pose an unacceptable risk to human health via inhalation of vapors migrating from groundwater into occupied buildings. These two objectives are consistent with the classifications of the Site groundwater under the Massachusetts Contingency Plan (MCP) (310 CMR 40.0932).&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;The groundwater quality performance standards for the GMAs are based on the groundwater classification categories designated in the MCP. These categories are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;GW-2 (protection of indoor air) - Groundwater that is a potential source of hazardous vapors to indoor air. Groundwater shall be classified as GW-2 if it is located within 30 feet of an existing occupied building and the average annual depth to groundwater is 15 feet or less.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;GW-3 (protection of surface water)- All groundwater shall be classified as GW-3 because it is a potential source of discharge to surface water.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;GE is required to meet the GW-2 and GW-3 groundwater standards for the compliance wells located in the GMAs, or take actions to ensure that groundwater constituents migrating into surface water do not pose a unacceptable risk to the environment or occupants of nearby buildings.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;The GW-1 standard, protection of drinking water, is non applicable at the Site because this area of Pittsfield I served by a municipal water system, which has a water source well upgradient of the Site.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Containment, defined as no discharge of NAPL to surface waters and/or sediments, which shall include no sheens on surface water and no bank seeps of NAPL.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;For areas near surface waters in which there is no physical containment barrier between the wells and the surface water, elimination of measurable NAPL (i.e., detectable with an oil/water interface probe) in wells near the surface water bank that could potentially discharge NAPL into the surface water, in order to prevent such discharge and assist in achieving groundwater quality Performance Standards.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;For areas adjacent to physical containment barriers, prevention of any measurable LNAPL migration around the ends of the physical containment barriers.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;For NAPL areas not located adjacent to surface waters, reduction in the amount of measurable NAPL to levels which eliminate the potential for NAPL migration toward surface water discharge areas or beyond GMA boundaries, and which assist in achieving groundwater quality Performance Standards.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;For NAPL located at depths of 15 feet or less from the ground surface and within a horizontal distance of 30 feet from an existing occupied building, a demonstration that constituents in the NAPL do not pose an unacceptable risk to occupants of such building via volatilization and transport to the indoor air of such building. Such demonstration may include assessment activities such as: NAPL sampling, soil gas sampling; desktop modeling of potential volatilization of chemicals from the NAPL (or associated groundwater) to the indoor air of the nearby occupied buildings; or sampling of the indoor air of such buildings.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Current Status&lt;/h2&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;GE has installed and continues to operate a number of systems at the GE Plant Area and certain former oxbow areas to address NAPL issues. This includes the operation of NAPL containment, recovery and treatment systems at the East Street Area 2 - South and Lyman Street Areas. In addition, GE operates NAPL recovery systems at the East Street Area 1, Newell 2 and Unkamet Brook Areas.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;GE has also implemented groundwater monitoring, assessment and response programs at all of the GMAs. GE has completed baseline monitoring at all five of the GMAs. GMAs 1 and 3 are currently being monitored under interim monitoring programs until long-term monitoring programs are recommended by GE and approved by EPA and MADEP. GMA 1 is scheduled to phase into the long-term monitoring program in 2014. GMA 3 is anticipated to phase into the long-term monitoring program in 2017, after soil remediation actives have been completed at the Unkamet Brook Removal Action Area. GMA 4 is currently in the long-term monitoring phase. The long-term monitoring program has been terminated at GMAs 2 and 5. However, GE is required to maintain certain wells and to conduct additional monitoring in these two GMAs at five year intervals.&lt;/p&gt;
