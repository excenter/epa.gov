    <title>Public Notification for CSOs to the Great Lakes Factsheet</title>
    <link>https://www.epa.gov/npdes/public-notification-csos-great-lakes-factsheet</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;On January 13, 2017, EPA published a proposed rule requesting comments on Public Notification Requirements for Combined Sewer Overflows to the Great Lakes Basin. The proposed rule would implement Section 425 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016 (Public Law 114113), which requires EPA to work with the Great Lakes states to establish public notification requirements for CSO discharges to the Great Lakes. &lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;
		&lt;h2&gt;Construction Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;Stormwater discharges from construction activities can significantly impact water quality. As stormwater flows over a construction site, it can pick up pollutants like sediment, debris, and chemicals and transport them to nearby storm sewer systems or directly into rivers, lakes, or coastal waters.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;The NPDES stormwater program requires permits for discharges from construction activities that disturb one or more acres, and discharges from smaller sites that are part of a larger common plan of development or sale. Construction stormwater permits include effluent limits for erosion and sediment control, pollution prevention, and site stabilization from the &lt;a href=&quot;/eg/construction-and-development-effluent-guidelines&quot;&gt;Construction and Development Effluent Guidelines and Standards regulations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;Depending on the location of the construction site, either the state (if it has been authorized to implement the NPDES stormwater program) or EPA will administer the permit. In areas where EPA is the permitting authority, operators of regulated construction sites are generally permitted under &lt;a href=&quot;/npdes/stormwater-discharges-construction-activities-2017-cgp#cgp&quot;&gt;EPA’s 2017 Construction General Permit (CGP)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/npdes/authorization-status-epas-construction-and-industrial-stormwater-programs&quot;&gt;Authorization Status for EPA&#039;s Construction and Industrial Stormwater Programs&lt;/a&gt; – Visit this page to find out whether EPA or your state is the permitting authority for industrial activities.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;div id=&quot;cgp&quot;&gt;
		&lt;h2&gt;EPA&#039;s 2017 Construction General Permit (CGP)&lt;/h2&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;On January 11, 2017, EPA&#039;s 2017 Construction General Permit (CGP) was issued. &lt;strong&gt;The 2017 CGP takes effect on February 16, 2017.&lt;/strong&gt;  EPA’s 2017 CGP requires compliance with effluent limits and other permit requirements, including the development of a &lt;a href=&quot;/npdes/stormwater-discharges-construction-activities#resources&quot;&gt;Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;If you intend to seek coverage under EPA&#039;s 2017 CGP, you must submit a Notice of Intent (NOI) using the &lt;a href=&quot;/npdes/stormwater-discharges-construction-activities-2017-cgp#ereporting&quot;&gt;NPDES eReporting Tool for the CGP&lt;/a&gt; certifying that you meet the permit’s eligibility conditions and will comply with the permit’s requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/npdes/epas-2017-construction-general-permit-cgp-and-related-documents&quot;&gt;EPA&#039;s 2017 CGP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/npdes/previous-versions-epas-cgp&quot;&gt;Previous Versions of EPA&#039;s CGP (2008 and 2003)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Coverage under EPA 2017 CGP&lt;/h3&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;EPA 2017 CGP coverage is available for operators of eligible construction activities in the following areas:&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Idaho, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Mexico, and the District of Columbia;&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;American Samoa, Guam, Johnston Atoll, Midway and Wake Islands, Northern Mariana Islands, and Puerto Rico;&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Indian Country lands within Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming;&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Areas within Colorado, Delaware, Vermont, and Washington subject to construction by a federal operator; and&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Limited areas of Oklahoma and Texas.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/npdes/epas-2017-construction-general-permit-cgp-and-related-documents&quot;&gt;Appendix B: Permit Areas Eligible for Coverage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;EPA 2017 CGP Noncompliance Reporting&lt;/h3&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;EPA 2017 CGP operators must report any instance of noncompliance that might endanger public health or the environment. They must notify the appropriate &lt;a href=&quot;/npdes/contact-us-stormwater#regional&quot;&gt;EPA regional office&lt;/a&gt; in accordance with &lt;a href=&quot;/npdes/epas-2017-construction-general-permit-cgp-and-related-documents&quot;&gt;Appendix I, Part I.12.6.1 of the 2017 CGP&lt;/a&gt;, which requires that:&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;any information must be provided orally within 24 hours from the time you become aware of the circumstances; and&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;a written submission must also be provided within five days of the time you become aware of the circumstances. The written submission must contain a description of the noncompliance and its cause; the period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times, and if the noncompliance has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Report any instance of noncompliance to your &lt;a href=&quot;/npdes/forms/contact-us-about-npdes&quot;&gt;EPA regional contacts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;who&quot; name=&quot;who&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Who Needs Coverage&lt;/h3&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;In general, you need CGP coverage if:&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;your site will disturb one or more acres of land, or less than one acre of land and is part of a common plan of development or sale that will ultimately disturb one or more acres of land; and &lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;you are responsible either for:
				&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;construction plans and specifications, including modifications to them (e.g., you are the owner or developer); or&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;daily site activities necessary to ensure compliance with a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) (e.g., you are the general contractor). &lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;how&quot; name=&quot;how&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;How to Obtain 2017 CGP Coverage&lt;/h3&gt;

		&lt;h4&gt;Step 1.&lt;/h4&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;Read the 2017 CGP and Fact Sheet&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/npdes/epas-2017-construction-general-permit-cgp-and-related-documents&quot;&gt;2017 CGP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/npdes/epas-2017-construction-general-permit-cgp-and-related-documents&quot;&gt;2017 CGP Fact Sheet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Step 2.&lt;/h4&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;Determine if you are eligible for coverage under this permit. Before submitting your Notice of Intent (NOI), the form you file to obtain coverage under the CGP in step 4, you must:&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Determine if your site is located in an area eligible for coverage found in&lt;a href=&quot;/npdes/epas-2017-construction-general-permit-cgp-and-related-documents&quot;&gt; Appendix B of the 2017 CGP – Permit Areas Eligible for Coverage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Follow the procedures in &lt;a href=&quot;/npdes/epas-2017-construction-general-permit-cgp-and-related-documents&quot;&gt;Appendix D of the 2017 CGP - Endangered Species Act (ESA) Requirements&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Follow the procedures in &lt;a href=&quot;/npdes/epas-2017-construction-general-permit-cgp-and-related-documents&quot;&gt;Appendix E of the 2017 CGP – Historic Property Screening Process&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Step 3.&lt;/h4&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;Develop a Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP).&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;A SWPPP outlines how you plan to implement erosion and sediment controls and meet other requirements of the permit on your construction site. Before submitting your Notice of Intent (NOI), the form you file to obtain coverage under the CGP in step 4, you must develop the SWPPP consistent with the requirements in Part 7 of the CGP.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/npdes/stormwater-discharges-construction-activities#resources&quot;&gt;SWPPPs for Construction Activities&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Step 4.&lt;/h4&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;Complete and submit an NOI for your site using &lt;a href=&quot;/npdes/stormwater-discharges-construction-activities-2017-cgp#ereporting&quot;&gt;EPA&#039;s NPDES eReporting Tool (NeT) for the CGP&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;To be covered under the 2017 CGP, you must submit your NOI by the deadline specified in the table below. The NOI certifies to EPA that you are eligible for coverage and provides information on your site’s construction activities and discharges.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;table&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;
						&lt;p&gt;Type of Operator&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/th&gt;
					&lt;th&gt;
						&lt;p&gt;Deadline to Submit NOI&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/th&gt;
					&lt;th&gt;
						&lt;p&gt;Permit Authorization Date&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/th&gt;
				&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
						&lt;p&gt;Operator of a new site (i.e., a site where construction activities commence on or after February 16, 2017)&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/td&gt;
					&lt;td&gt;
						&lt;p&gt;At least 14 calendar days before commencing construction activities.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/td&gt;
					&lt;td rowspan=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
						&lt;p&gt;14 calendar days after EPA notifies you that it has received a complete NOI, unless EPA notifies you that your authorization is delayed or denied.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/td&gt;
				&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
						&lt;p&gt;Operator of an existing site (i.e., a site with 2012 CGP coverage where construction activities commenced prior to February 16, 2017)&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/td&gt;
					&lt;td&gt;No later than May 17, 2017.&lt;/td&gt;
				&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;New operator of a permitted site (i.e., an operator that through transfer of ownership and/or operation replaces the operator of an already permitted construction site that is either a “new site” or an “existing site”)&lt;/td&gt;
					&lt;td&gt;
						&lt;p&gt;At least 14 calendar days before the date the transfer to the new operator will take place.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/td&gt;
				&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
						&lt;p&gt;Emergency-related project (i.e., a project initiated in response to a public emergency (e.g., mud slides, earthquake, extreme flooding conditions, disruption in essential public services), for which the related work requires immediate authorization to avoid imminent endangerment to human health or the environment, or to reestablish essential public services)&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/td&gt;
					&lt;td&gt;
						&lt;p&gt;No later than 30 calendar days after commencing construction activities.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/td&gt;
					&lt;td&gt;
						&lt;p&gt;Provisionally covered under CGP terms and conditions immediately.&lt;br /&gt;
							Fully covered 14 calendar days after EPA notifies you that it has received a complete NOI, unless EPA notifies you that your authorization is delayed or denied.&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/td&gt;
				&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;modifying&quot; name=&quot;modifying&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Modifying an NOI&lt;/h3&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;Use the &lt;a href=&quot;/npdes/stormwater-discharges-construction-activities-2017-cgp#ereporting&quot;&gt;NeT&lt;/a&gt; system to modify your NOI. The following modifications to an NOI form will result in a 14-day review process:&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Estimated area to be disturbed&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Endangered Species Protection information&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Historic Preservation information&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Use of Chemical Treatment at your site&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Demolition of structures over 10,000 square feet of floor space built or renovated before January 1, 1980&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the 14-day review process, you may continue to operate based on the information provided in your original NOI, but you must wait until the review period has ended before you can commence or continue activities on any portion of your site that would be affected by any of the above modifications, unless EPA notifies you that the authorization is delayed or denied.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;terminate&quot; name=&quot;terminate&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;How to Terminate Permit Coverage&lt;/h3&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;a href=&quot;/npdes/stormwater-discharges-construction-activities-2017-cgp#reporting&quot;&gt;NeT&lt;/a&gt; to submit a Notice of Termination (NOT).&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;EPA requires construction operators who seek coverage or a waiver under the 2017 CGP to electronically prepare and submit the following forms through the NPDES eReporting Tool for CGP (NeT-CGP):&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Notice of Intent (NOI)&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Change an NOI&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Notice of Termination (NOT)&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Low Erosivity Waiver (LEW)&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note for operators of existing sites:&lt;/strong&gt; If you are an operator of a site with 2012 CGP coverage where construction activities commenced prior to February 16, 2017, you are required to submit a new NOI for coverage under the 2017 CGP using NeT-CGP by May 17, 2017. You are not required to submit an NOT to terminate coverage under the 2012 CGP.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;Although the eNOI system will be replaced by NeT-CGP on February 16, 2017, the eNOI system will not be shut down and limited functionality will be maintained. You will still be able to access eNOI and view any documents you have previously submitted. You will also be able to submit an NOT through eNOI if you no longer need CGP coverage for your site.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;While all new NOIs or LEWs will have to be submitted to NeT-CGP, NOTs for NOIs submitted for the 2012 CGP must still be submitted to eNOI. The eNOI system will be available until August 2017 to accommodate the transition period between systems.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;accessing&quot; name=&quot;accessing&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Accessing NeT-CGP&lt;/h3&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;NeT-CGP is accessed through EPA&#039;s Central Data Exchange (CDX).&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;Steps for accessing NeT-CGP will be provided prior to the 2017 CGP effective date on February 16, 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;noiguidance&quot; name=&quot;noiguidance&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Guidance and Training&lt;/h3&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;To introduce stakeholders to NeT-CGP, EPA will release a quick start brochure, a user guide, and conduct a series of live webinar trainings. Links to the material will be posted on this CGP website, the NeT Zendesk site, and the NPDES eReporting website in early February 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;div&gt;Three live webinar training sessions will be held for current and future CGP operators from 1:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. EST on:&lt;/div&gt;

		&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;February 2, 2017&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;February 7, 2017&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;February 9, 2017&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;All operators associated with your construction site who seek coverage under the 2017 CGP must submit an NOI and are encouraged to attend one of the training sessions. Anyone who currently is or will be responsible for preparing an NOI is also encouraged to attend. The webinars will cover how to register with CDX, submit an NOI, change an NOI, submit an LEW, and submit an NOT. Each session is the same so you need to attend only one. The webinar will be recorded and posted for future viewing.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;To register for any of the webinar sessions, visit the &lt;a href=&quot;https://epanet.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/235540127-CGP-Training-Schedule&quot;&gt;NeT CGP support website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;EPA has created an email subscription service for CGP stakeholders on NeT announcements. Operators with active projects under the 2012 CGP are already subscribed to this service. To register for this service, visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://epanet.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/235540967&quot;&gt;GovDelivery Email Subscription for CGP&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;h2&gt;Construction Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;Stormwater discharges from construction activities can significantly impact water quality. As stormwater flows over a construction site, it can pick up pollutants like sediment, debris, and chemicals and transport them to nearby storm sewer systems or directly into rivers, lakes, or coastal waters.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;The NPDES stormwater program requires permits for discharges from construction activities that disturb one or more acres, and discharges from smaller sites that are part of a larger common plan of development or sale. Construction stormwater permits include effluent limits for erosion and sediment control, pollution prevention, and site stabilization from the &lt;a href=&quot;/eg/construction-and-development-effluent-guidelines&quot;&gt;Construction and Development Effluent Guidelines and Standards regulations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;Depending on the location of the construction site, either the state (if it has been authorized to implement the NPDES stormwater program) or EPA will administer the permit. In areas where EPA is the permitting authority, operators of regulated construction sites are generally permitted under &lt;a href=&quot;/npdes/stormwater-discharges-construction-activities-2012-cgp#cgp&quot;&gt;EPA’s 2012 Construction General Permit (CGP)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/npdes/authorization-status-epas-construction-and-industrial-stormwater-programs&quot;&gt;Authorization Status for EPA&#039;s Construction and Industrial Stormwater Programs&lt;/a&gt; – Visit this page to find out whether EPA or your state is the permitting authority for industrial activities.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;div id=&quot;cgp&quot;&gt;
		&lt;h2&gt;EPA&#039;s 2012 Construction General Permit (CGP)&lt;/h2&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;On February 16, 2012, EPA&#039;s 2012 Construction General Permit (CGP) was issued. EPA’s 2012 CGP requires compliance with effluent limits and other permit requirements, including the development of a &lt;a href=&quot;/npdes/stormwater-discharges-construction-activities#resources&quot;&gt;stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;If you intend to seek coverage under EPA&#039;s 2012 CGP, you must submit a notice of intent (NOI) using the &lt;a href=&quot;/npdes/stormwater-discharges-construction-activities-2012-cgp#ereporting&quot;&gt;electronic NOI (eNOI) system&lt;/a&gt; certifying that you meet the permit’s eligibility conditions and will comply with the permit’s requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/npdes/epas-2012-construction-general-permit-cgp-and-related-documents&quot;&gt;EPA&#039;s 2012 CGP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/npdes/previous-versions-epas-cgp&quot;&gt;Previous Versions of EPA&#039;s CGP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Coverage under EPA 2012 CGP&lt;/h3&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;EPA 2012 CGP coverage is available for operators of eligible construction activities in the following areas:&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Idaho, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Mexico, and the District of Columbia;&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;American Samoa, Guam, Johnston Atoll, Midway and Wake Islands, Northern Mariana Islands, and Puerto Rico;&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Indian Country lands within Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming;&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;areas within Colorado, Delaware, Vermont, and Washington subject to construction by a federal operator; and&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;limited areas of Oklahoma and Texas.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/npdes/epas-2012-construction-general-permit-cgp-and-related-documents&quot;&gt;Appendix B: Permit Areas Eligible for Coverage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;EPA 2012 CGP Noncompliance Reporting&lt;/h3&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;EPA 2012 CGP permittees must report any instance of noncompliance that might endanger public health or the environment. They must notify the appropriate EPA regional office in accordance with &lt;a href=&quot;/npdes/epas-2012-construction-general-permit-cgp-and-related-documents&quot;&gt;Appendix I, Part I.12.6.1 of the 2012 CGP&lt;/a&gt;, which requires that:&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;any information must be provided orally within 24 hours from the time you become aware of the circumstances; and&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;a written submission must also be provided within five days of the time you become aware of the circumstances. The written submission must contain a description of the noncompliance and its cause; the period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times, and if the noncompliance has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Report any instance of noncompliance to your &lt;a href=&quot;/npdes/forms/contact-us-about-npdes&quot;&gt;EPA regional contacts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;

		&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;who&quot; name=&quot;who&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Who Needs Coverage&lt;/h3&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;In general, you need CGP coverage if:&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;your project will disturb one or more acres of land, or less than one acre of land and is part of a common plan of development or sale that will ultimately disturb one or more acres of land; and &lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;you are responsible either for:
				&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;construction plans and specifications, including modifications to them (e.g., you are the owner or developer); or&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;daily project activities necessary to ensure compliance with a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) (e.g., you are the general contractor). &lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;how&quot; name=&quot;how&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;How to Obtain 2012 CGP Coverage&lt;/h3&gt;

		&lt;h4&gt;Step 1.&lt;/h4&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;Read the 2012 CGP and Fact Sheet&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/npdes/epas-2012-construction-general-permit-cgp-and-related-documents&quot;&gt;2012 CGP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/npdes/epas-2012-construction-general-permit-cgp-and-related-documents&quot;&gt;2012 CGP Fact Sheet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Step 2.&lt;/h4&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;Determine if you are eligible for coverage&lt;br /&gt;
			Review the following documents for guidance in determining if your project is located in an area eligible for coverage and meets endangered species and historic property requirements:&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/npdes/epas-2012-construction-general-permit-cgp-and-related-documents&quot;&gt;Appendix B of the 2012 CGP – Permit Areas Eligible for Coverage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/npdes/epas-2012-construction-general-permit-cgp-and-related-documents&quot;&gt;Appendix D of the 2012 CGP - Endangered Species Act (ESA) Requirements&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/npdes/epas-2012-construction-general-permit-cgp-and-related-documents&quot;&gt;Appendix E of the 2012 CGP – Historic Property Screening Process&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Step 3.&lt;/h4&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;Develop a SWPPP&lt;br /&gt;
			A SWPPP outlines how you plan to implement erosion and sediment controls and other best management practices (BMPs) on your construction site. You must develop the SWPPP before submitting a Notice of Intent (NOI) to obtain permit coverage. &lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/npdes/stormwater-discharges-construction-activities#resources&quot;&gt;SWPPPs for Construction Activities&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/npdes/national-menu-best-management-practices-bmps-stormwater&quot;&gt;National Menu of Stormwater BMPs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Step 4.&lt;/h4&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;Complete and submit an NOI for your project &lt;br /&gt;
			Submit your NOI using &lt;a href=&quot;/npdes/stormwater-discharges-construction-activities-2012-cgp#ereporting&quot;&gt;EPA&#039;s electronic Notice of Intent (eNOI) system&lt;/a&gt;. Alternatively, you may contact your &lt;a href=&quot;/npdes/forms/contact-us-about-npdes&quot;&gt;EPA regional office&lt;/a&gt; for approval to submit a paper form. &lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/npdes/epas-2012-construction-general-permit-cgp-and-related-documents&quot;&gt;Appendix J of the 2012 CGP – NOI Form&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: Signing and submitting the NOI form obligates you to comply with the terms of the CGP.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p class=&quot;pagetop&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#main-content&quot;&gt;Top of Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;deadlines&quot; name=&quot;deadlines&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Deadlines for Submitting an NOI&lt;/h3&gt;

		&lt;table&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;
						&lt;p&gt;Type of Project&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/th&gt;
					&lt;th&gt;
						&lt;p&gt;Deadline to Submit NOI&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/th&gt;
					&lt;th&gt;
						&lt;p&gt;Official Start Date for CGP Coverage&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/th&gt;
				&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
						&lt;p&gt;New project&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-1-1&quot;&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;The National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) is a federal permitting program under the authority of the Clean Water Act (CWA) that establishes controls on point source discharges of pollutants to waters of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Point sources are defined at CWA section 502(14) and, generally speaking, are discrete conveyances including but not limited to any pipe, ditch, channel, or conduit from which pollutants are or may be discharged.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The term waters of the United States is defined in EPA’s regulations at 40 CFR 230.3(s).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The term pollutant is defined at 40 CFR 122.2 and means dredged spoil, solid waste, incinerator residue, filter backwash, sewage, garbage, sewage sludge, munitions, chemical wastes, biological materials, radioactive materials (except those regulated under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (42 USC 2011 et seq.)), heat, wrecked or discarded equipment, rock, sand, cellar dirt and industrial, municipal, and agricultural waste discharged into water.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-1-2&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;What is the EPA Construction General Permit (CGP)?&lt;/a&gt;
				&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-1-2&quot;&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;The EPA Construction General Permit (CGP) is an NPDES general permit issued by EPA under the authority of the CWA and associated regulations. At present, EPA has issued and administers the CGP in four states (Idaho, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and New Mexico), the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, all other U.S. territories with the exception of the Virgin Islands, areas in four states (Colorado, Delaware, Vermont, and Washington) subject to construction by Federal Operators, most of Indian Country, and a few other specifically designated activities in specific states. All other areas of the United States are generally covered under state-issued construction stormwater permits.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The EPA CGP authorizes, subject to specific terms and conditions, the discharge of stormwater from construction sites or activities that disturb one acre or more of land, and from smaller sites that are part of a larger, common plan of development. The EPA CGP requires operators of such construction sites or activities to implement stormwater controls and to develop stormwater pollution prevention plans (SWPPPs) in an effort to minimize the amount of sediment and other pollutants associated with construction sites from being discharged in stormwater runoff.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p class=&quot;pagetop&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#main-content&quot;&gt;Top of Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-1-3&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;Why is it necessary to authorize or permit stormwater discharges from construction sites?&lt;/a&gt;
				&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-1-3&quot;&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;As stormwater flows over a construction site, it can pick up pollutants like sediment, turbidity, debris, nutrients, and chemicals and transport these to receiving waterbodies. Stormwater discharges containing sediment and turbidity can cause an array of negative physical, chemical, and biological impacts on receiving waters. In addition to sediment and turbidity, a number of other pollutants (e.g., metals, organic compounds, nutrients) are preferentially absorbed or adsorbed onto mineral or organic particles found in fine sediment. The sediment, turbidity, and other pollutants entrained in stormwater discharges associated with construction activity contribute to aquatic ecosystem degradation, increased drinking water treatment costs, and impairment of the recreational use and aesthetic value of impacted waters. Sediment can also accumulate in rivers, lakes, reservoirs, and other waters, leading to the need for dredging or other mitigation in order to ensure adequate water storage or navigation capacity. The requirements in the EPA CGP ensure that operators minimize the discharge of sediment and other construction site pollutants in stormwater to surface waters.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p class=&quot;pagetop&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#main-content&quot;&gt;Top of Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-1-4&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;Do state-issued permits have to be the same as the EPA-issued permits for stormwater discharges from construction activities?&lt;/a&gt;
				&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-1-4&quot;&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;No. Nothing in the Clean Water Act precludes a state from adopting or enforcing requirements that may be more appropriate to address discharges in their state, or that are more stringent or more extensive than those required under the NPDES regulations while still meeting their obligations under the Clean Water Act. EPA does note, however, than any state-issued CGP must incorporate or be as stringent as the C&amp;amp;D rule. Whether EPA, a state, or a tribe issues the permit, the CWA and EPA regulations require that NPDES permits include technology-based effluent limitations (CWA section 301(b)(1)(A); 40 CFR section 122.44(a)). In addition, where the discharge with technology-based effluent limitations would have reasonable potential to cause or contribute to an exceedance of applicable water quality standards, the permit must contain water quality-based effluent limitations as necessary to meet those standards (CWA section 301(b)(1)(C); 40 CFR section 122.44(d)). States are free to incorporate additional requirements that they believe are reasonably necessary and/or helpful to adequately protect water quality in their respective jurisdictions. Although states can issue permit requirements that differ from EPA, the Agency recognizes that, with respect to stormwater general permits, many state-issued general permits follow EPA’s general permit and content.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;ul class=&quot;accordion&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-2-1&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;What types of construction activities must obtain NPDES permit coverage for their stormwater discharges?&lt;/a&gt;

				&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-2-1&quot;&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, any “construction activity” that will disturb, or that is part of a “common plan” of development or sale that will disturb, one or more acres of land and discharges stormwater to one or more waters of the U.S. must obtain NPDES permit coverage. Note that there are situations in which construction activities can be waived or excused from the requirement to obtain NPDES permit coverage (see related &lt;a href=&quot;#pane2-4&quot;&gt;Q&amp;amp;A below&lt;/a&gt;). “Construction activity”, as defined in Appendix A of the 2012 EPA CGP, includes earth-disturbing activities, such as the clearing, grading, and excavation of land. Also authorized under the CGP are discharges of stormwater from “construction support activities”, which include construction-related activities that specifically support the construction activity and involve earth disturbance or pollutant-generating activities of its own (e.g., activities associated with concrete or asphalt batch plants, equipment staging yards, materials storage areas, excavated material disposal areas, borrow areas).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;“Construction Activity” does not refer to unrelated to earth-disturbing activities such as interior remodeling, completion of interiors of structures, etc. &quot;Construction activity&quot; also does not include routine earth disturbing activities that are part of the normal day-to-day operation of a completed facility (e.g., daily cover for landfills, maintenance of gravel roads or parking areas, landscape maintenance, etc.) nor activities under a state or federal reclamation program to return an abandoned facility property to an agricultural or open land use (as opposed to demolition of something in order to build something new).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p class=&quot;pagetop&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#main-content&quot;&gt;Top of Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-2-2&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;Are there situations where a permit is not needed?&lt;/a&gt;
				&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-2-2&quot;&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;If all of the stormwater from the construction activity is captured on-site and allowed to evaporate, soak into the ground on-site, or is used for irrigation, you do not need a permit. Under the Clean Water Act, it is illegal to have a point source discharge of pollutants to a water of the United States that is not authorized by a permit. If you believe there is a potential for a discharge, EPA recommends that you apply for permit coverage before any discharge occurs. The best management practices that you use to keep the stormwater on your site must be effective under any size storm. You may also have an obligation to the state/tribe concerning discharges to ground water or impoundment of runoff (e.g., water rights).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p class=&quot;pagetop&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#main-content&quot;&gt;Top of Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-2-3&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;What if earth disturbance is a normal part of the post-construction use of the site?&lt;/a&gt;
				&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-2-3&quot;&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;The earth disturbing activity has to be part of a project to build, demolish, or replace a structure (e.g., building, road, pad, pipeline, transmission line, etc.) to trigger the need for permit coverage. Earth disturbance that is a normal part of the long-term use or maintenance of the property is not covered by the construction general permit. For example, re-grading a dirt road or cleaning out a roadside drainage ditch to maintain its &quot;as built&quot; state is road maintenance and not construction. Restoring the original well pad to work over an existing oil or gas well is operation of a well and not construction. Re-grading and re-graveling a gravel parking lot or equipment pad is site maintenance and not construction. Repaving is routine maintenance unless underlying and/or surrounding soil is cleared, graded, or excavated as part of the repaving operation. Where clearing, grading, or excavating (i.e., down to bare soils) takes place, permit coverage is required if more than one acre is disturbed. Reworking planters that are part of the landscaping at a building is landscape maintenance and not construction. Applying daily cover at a landfill is simply part of operating a landfill and not construction.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p class=&quot;pagetop&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#main-content&quot;&gt;Top of Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;/li&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Waivers are possible only for discharges of stormwater associated with small construction activity (i.e., construction disturbing less than 5 acres). These waivers are authorized by federal regulation at 40 CFR 122.26(b)(15)(i)(A) &amp;amp; (B) and are explained in &lt;a href=&quot;/npdes/epas-2012-construction-general-permit-cgp-and-related-documents&quot;&gt;Appendix C&lt;/a&gt; of the permit. Waivers are not available for any construction activity disturbing 5 acres or greater, or less than 5 acres if part of a common plan of development or sale that will ultimately disturb 5 or more acres (or if designated for permit coverage by EPA).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p class=&quot;pagetop&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#main-content&quot;&gt;Top of Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-2-5&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;My project will disturb less than one acre, but it might be part of a &quot;larger common plan of development or sale.&quot;  How can I tell and what must I do?&lt;/a&gt;
				&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-2-5&quot;&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;In many cases, a common plan of development or sale consists of many small construction projects. For example, an original common plan of development for a residential subdivision might lay out the streets, house lots, and areas for parks, schools and commercial development that the developer plans to build or sell to others for development. All these areas would remain part of the common plan of development or sale until the intended construction occurs.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If your smaller project is part of a larger common plan of development or sale that collectively will disturb one or more acres (e.g., you are building on 6 half-acre residential lots in a 10-acre development or are putting in a fast food restaurant on a 3/4 acre pad that is part of a 20 acre retail center) you need permit coverage. The &quot;common plan&quot; in a common plan of development or sale is broadly defined as any announcement or piece of documentation (including a sign, public notice or hearing, sales pitch, advertisement, drawing, permit application, zoning request, computer design, etc.) or physical demarcation (including boundary signs, lot stakes, surveyor markings, etc.) indicating construction activities may occur on a specific plot. You must still meet the definition of operator in order to be required to get permit coverage, regardless of the acreage you personally disturb. As a subcontractor, it is unlikely you would need a permit.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;However, where only a small portion of the original common plan of development remains undeveloped and there has been a period of time where there is no ongoing construction activities (i.e., all areas are either undisturbed or have been finally stabilized), you can re-evaluate your individual project based on the acreage remaining from the original &quot;common plan.&quot; If less than five but more than one acre remains to build out the original &quot;common plan&quot; a permit might still be required, but you can treat your project as part of a &quot;small&quot; construction activity and might be eligible for the waivers available for small construction activities (e.g., one of six lots totaling 2 acres in a 50 acre subdivision can be treated as part of a 2 acre rather than 50 acre &quot;common plan&quot;). If less than one acre remains of the original common plan, your individual project could be treated as part of a less than one acre development and no permit would be required.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p class=&quot;pagetop&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#main-content&quot;&gt;Top of Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-2-6&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;When can you consider future construction on a property to be part of a separate plan of development or sale?&lt;/a&gt;
				&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-2-6&quot;&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;After the initial &quot;common plan&quot; construction activity is completed for a particular parcel, any subsequent development or redevelopment of that parcel would be regarded as a new plan of development. For example, after a house is built and occupied, any future construction on that lot (e.g., reconstructing after fire, adding a pool or parking area for a boat, etc.), would stand alone as a new &quot;common plan&quot; for purposes of calculating acreage disturbed to determine if a permit was required. This would also apply to similar situations at an industrial facility, such as adding new buildings, a pipeline, new wastewater treatment facility, etc. that was not part of the original plan.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p class=&quot;pagetop&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#main-content&quot;&gt;Top of Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-2-7&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;What if the extent of the common plan of development or sale is contingent on future activities?&lt;/a&gt;
				&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-2-7&quot;&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;EPA recognizes that there are situations where you will not know up front exactly how many acres will be disturbed, or whether some activities will even occur with certainty. If you are not sure exactly how many acres will be disturbed, you should make the best estimate possible and might wish to overestimate to ensure you do not run into the situation where you should have a permit, but don&#039;t. For example, if you originally estimated less than 5 acres would actually be disturbed and took advantage of the &quot;R&quot; Factor waiver, but you actually disturbed 5.5 acres, you would lose your waiver and may have to go through the permit process mid-stream. This could result in delays in obtaining permit authorization and costs associated with contract changes to implement permit requirements - in addition to being liable for any unpermitted discharges.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you have a long-range master plan of development where some portions of the master plan are a conceptual rather than a specific plan of future development and the future construction activities would, if they occur at all, happen over an extended time period, you might consider the &quot;conceptual&quot; phases of development to be separate &quot;common plans&quot; provided the periods of construction for the physically interconnected phases will not overlap. For example, a university or an airport may have a long-range development concept for their property, with future development based largely on future needs and availability of funding. A school district could buy more land than needed for a high school with an indefinite plan to add more classrooms and a sports facility someday. An oil and gas exploration and production company could have a broad plan to develop wells within a lease or production area, but decisions on how many wells would be drilled within what time frame and which wells would be tied to a pipeline would be largely driven by current market conditions and which, if any, wells proved to be commercially viable.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p class=&quot;pagetop&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#main-content&quot;&gt;Top of Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-2-8&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;What if the &quot;common plan of development or sale&quot; actually consists of non-contiguous separate projects?&lt;/a&gt;
				&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-2-8&quot;&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;There are several situations where discrete projects that could conceivably be considered part of a larger &quot;common plan&quot; can actually be treated as separate projects for the purposes of permitting:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A public body (e.g., a municipality, state, tribe, or federal agency) need not consider all their construction projects within their entire jurisdiction to be part of an overall &quot;common plan.&quot; For example, construction of roads or buildings in different parts of a state, city, military base, university campus, etc. can be considered as separate &quot;common plans.&quot; Only the interconnected parts of single project would be considered to be a &quot;common plan&quot; (e.g., a building and its associated parking lot and driveways, airport runway and associated taxiways, a building complex, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
						&lt;li&gt;Where discrete construction projects within a larger common plan of development or sale are located at least 1/4 mile apart and the area between the projects is not being disturbed, each individual project can be treated as a separate plan of development or sale provided any interconnecting road, pipeline or utility project that is part of the same &quot;common plan&quot; is not concurrently being disturbed. For example, two oil and gas well pads separated by 1/4 mile could be treated as separate &quot;common plans.&quot; However, if the same two well pads and an interconnecting access road were all under construction at the same time, they would generally be considered as part of a single &quot;common plan&quot; for permitting purposes. If a utility company was constructing new trunk lines off an existing transmission line to serve separate residential subdivisions located more than 1/4 mile apart, the two trunk line projects could be considered to be separate projects.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;pagetop&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#main-content&quot;&gt;Top of Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-2-9&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;Is NPDES permit coverage required for oil and gas construction?&lt;/a&gt;
				&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-2-9&quot;&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;Oil and gas construction activities are exempt from the requirement to obtain NPDES permit coverage unless the facility meets one of the conditions in 40 CFR 122.26(c)(1)(iii) noted below.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The following regulations applicable to oil and gas construction activities are currently in effect:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p class=&quot;indented&quot;&gt;40 CFR § 122.26(a)(2) The Director may not require a permit for discharges of storm water runoff from mining operations or oil and gas exploration, production, processing or treatment operations or transmission facilities, composed entirely of flows which are from conveyances or systems of conveyances (including but not limited to pipes, conduits, ditches, and channels) used for collecting and conveying precipitation runoff and which are not contaminated by contact with or that has not come into contact with, any overburden, raw material, intermediate products, finished product, byproduct or waste products located on the site of such operations.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p class=&quot;indented&quot;&gt;40 CFR § 122.26(c)(1)(iii) The operator of an existing or new discharge composed entirely of storm water from an oil or gas exploration, production, processing, or treatment operation, or transmission facility is not required to submit a permit application in accordance with paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, unless the facility:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol type=&quot;A&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Has had a discharge of storm water resulting in the discharge of a reportable quantity for which notification is or was required pursuant to 40 CFR 117.21 or 40 CFR 302.6 at any time since November 16, 1987; or&lt;/li&gt;
						&lt;li&gt;Has had a discharge of storm water resulting in the discharge of a reportable quantity for which notification is or was required pursuant to 40 CFR 110.6 at any time since November 16, 1987; or&lt;/li&gt;
						&lt;li&gt;Contributes to a violation of a water quality standard.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also in effect is the provision added to the Clean Water Act in accordance with Section 323 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 defining the term “oil and gas exploration, production, processing, or treatment operations or transmission facilities” to mean “all field activities or operations associated with exploration, production, processing, or treatment operations, or transmission facilities, including activities necessary to prepare a site for drilling and for the movement and placement of drilling equipment, whether or not such field activities or operations may be considered to be construction activity.” See 33 U.S.C. § 1362(24).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The exemption at 122.26(c)(1)(iii) does not apply to Clean Water Act (CWA) 404 permits. The exemption only applies to stormwater discharges from oil and gas exploration, production, processing or treatment, or transmission facilities (e.g., facilities/activities directly related to extraction or basic oil/gas processing such as fractionation plants, and not to such operations as liquified natural gas (LNG) re-gasification and ethanol plants). The exemption does not apply and permit coverage is required when construction activities associated with any of these facilities either 1) had a discharge of stormwater resulting in the discharge of a reportable quantity for which notification is required (e.g., oil sheen), anytime since November 16, 1987, or 2) contribute to a violation of a water quality standard (e.g., sediment discharges violating a water quality criteria or causing loss of fishing resources). Additionally, if any portion of the construction activity associated with one of these facilities no longer qualifies for the oil and gas exemption, the operator must obtain construction stormwater permit coverage for all subsequent discharges of pollutants to a water of the U.S. from the site. If the operator determines that all of the construction activities associated with the facility are in fact exempt, the owner/operator is not required to obtain NPDES construction stormwater permit coverage (although EPA encourages development and implementation of a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP)). However, if the project has had a stormwater discharge of a reportable quantity or a stormwater discharge that contributes to a violation of a water quality standard, the operator is in violation of the CWA prohibition on the discharge of a pollutant by a point source to a water of the U.S. without NPDES permit coverage for any subsequent discharges. The operator might then be subject to penalties if they do not obtain NPDES construction stormwater permit coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-3-1&quot;&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;Operators of construction activities that will disturb one or more acres of land (or that will disturb less than one acre but are part of a common plan of development or sale that will ultimately disturb one acre or more) in an area where EPA is the NPDES permitting authority can apply for coverage under EPA’s CGP. Operators requiring CGP coverage include any party associated with a construction activity that meets either of the following two criteria: (1) The party has operational control over construction plans and specifications, including the ability to make modifications to those plans and specifications; or (2) The party has day-to-day operational control of those activities at a project that are necessary to ensure compliance with the permit conditions (e.g., they are authorized to direct workers at a site to carry out activities required by the permit). Where there are multiple operators associated with the same project, all operators are required to obtain coverage under the EPA CGP.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;To be authorized under the 2012 EPA CGP, the operator must meet the eligibility requirements specified in Part 1.1 of the permit. The operator must also submit a Notice of Intent (NOI), which provides certification that the eligibility requirements have been met and that permit requirements will be complied with.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-3-2&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;What is an NOI?&lt;/a&gt;
				&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-3-2&quot;&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;EPA’s 2012 CGP relies on the submission of an electronic document called a Notice of Intent (NOI) to provide coverage under its permit. An NOI for a general permit is notice to the NPDES permitting authority (EPA in this instance) of the operator’s intent to be covered under the general permit. An NOI typically contains basic information about the site and the proposed discharge. By signing and submitting the NOI, the operator is certifying that the information submitted is true, accurate, and complete, that the operator meets the eligibility requirements, and that, if and when covered, the operator will comply with the permit conditions and effluent limitations. A fraudulent or erroneous NOI invalidates permit coverage. An incomplete NOI delays permit coverage until such time as the NOI has been completed and the applicable waiting period has passed (e.g., 14 days for the EPA CGP).&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-3-3&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;What type of information must be submitted in an NOI?&lt;/a&gt;
				&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-3-3&quot;&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;Operators must provide the following in their NOI for coverage under the 2012 EPA CGP:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;NPDES permit number;&lt;/li&gt;
						&lt;li&gt;Operator information;&lt;/li&gt;

						&lt;li&gt;Contact information for NOI preparer.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A paper copy of the NOI is included as &lt;a href=&quot;/npdes/epas-2012-construction-general-permit-cgp-and-related-documents&quot;&gt;Appendix J&lt;/a&gt; of the 2012 EPA CGP.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-3-4&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;Who is responsible for submitting the NOI for EPA CGP coverage?&lt;/a&gt;
				&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-3-4&quot;&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;If a project is eligible for coverage under the EPA CGP, and CGP coverage is sought, the operator is responsible for submitting an NOI to be covered under the permit. That is, if you meet either of the following two criteria, you are responsible for submitting an NOI to be covered under the permit:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You have operational control over construction plans and specifications, including the ability to make modifications to those plans and specifications (e.g., you are the owner or developer of the project), or&lt;/li&gt;
						&lt;li&gt;You have day-to-day operational control of those activities at a project which are necessary to ensure compliance with the permit conditions (e.g., you are authorized to direct workers at a site to carry out activities required by the permit and/or you are the general contractor).&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The party that meets the first part of the definition of “operator” &lt;em&gt;(the party that has operational control over construction plans and specifications, including the ability to make modifications to those plans and specifications)&lt;/em&gt; in most cases will be the owner of the site. The party that meets the second part of the definition of “operator” &lt;em&gt;(the party that has day-to-day operational control of those activities at a project that are necessary to ensure compliance with the permit conditions)&lt;/em&gt; in most cases will be the general contractor of the project. Where there are multiple operators associated with the same project, all parties meeting the definition of “operator” must submit an NOI to be covered under the EPA CGP if such coverage is sought.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;You are probably not an operator, and therefore are not responsible for submitting an NOI to be covered under the EPA CGP, if:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You are a subcontractor hired by, and under the supervision of, the owner or a general contractor (i.e., if the general contractor directs your activities on-site, you probably are not an operator); or&lt;/li&gt;
						&lt;li&gt;Your activities on-site result in an earth disturbance and you are not legally a subcontractor, but there is another entity with permit coverage for the project and they have a SWPPP that specifically identifies someone other than you (or your subcontractor) as the party having operational control to address the impacts your activities might have on stormwater quality (i.e., another operator has assumed responsibility for the impacts of your construction activities). EPA anticipates that this will be the case for many, if not most, utility service line installations.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;pagetop&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#main-content&quot;&gt;Top of Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-3-5&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;If I want to pursue EPA CGP coverage, how many Notices of Intent (NOIs) must I submit?&lt;/a&gt;
				&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-3-5&quot;&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;As discussed in the previous answer, each operator for a project must submit one NOI to cover the areas of the project that are under his/her control. For example, if you are building homes on multiple lots as part of a larger residential subdivision development, you can submit one NOI to cover all of your lots, even if they are on opposite sides of the development.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p class=&quot;pagetop&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#main-content&quot;&gt;Top of Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-3-6&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;My project’s disturbances will occur in an area covered by EPA’s CGP and in an area covered under a state-issued construction stormwater permit. Do I need coverage under both the EPA-issued CGP and the state-issued permit?&lt;/a&gt;
				&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-3-6&quot;&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;Operators of projects disturbing one or more acres of land where only a portion of the project occurs in an area where EPA is the NPDES permitting authority (and there will be a discharge of pollutants (stormwater) to waters of the United States within the area where EPA is the permitting authority) need coverage under an EPA-issued construction stormwater permit (e.g., the CGP), and likely would need coverage from the NPDES permitting authority(ies) that have jurisdiction over the other portions of the project (i.e., from a state or tribal permitting authority) if there will be a discharge of pollutants (stormwater) to waters of the United States in the other area. For example, if a project has contiguous disturbances or disturbances that are part of a common plan of development or sale that occur both in the State of New Mexico and the State of Arizona, and the disturbances will total an acre or more of land and will result in the discharge of pollutants through stormwater in both states, the operator of the project will need coverage under an EPA-issued stormwater permit (e.g., the CGP) for the disturbances in New Mexico and, if required by the State of Arizona, an Arizona-issued stormwater permit (even if the portion of the project in EPA’s jurisdiction is less than an acre).&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-3-7&quot;&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;You must use the electronic Notice of Intent (eNOI) system to prepare and submit your NOI. However, if you have a problem with the use of the eNOI system, contact the EPA Regional Office that corresponds to the location of your site. If you are given approval by the EPA Regional Office to use a paper NOI, and you elect to use it, you must complete the paper NOI form in &lt;a href=&quot;/npdes/epas-2012-construction-general-permit-cgp-and-related-documents&quot;&gt;Appendix J&lt;/a&gt; of the EPA CGP. The eNOI system can be accessed at the &lt;a href=&quot;/npdes/electronic-notice-intent-enoi&quot;&gt;Electronic Notice of Intent (eNOI) page&lt;/a&gt;. You must also look in Part 9 of the permit to determine if copies of the NOI form must be sent to a state or Indian tribe.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-3-9&quot;&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;The certifier of the NOI for the EPA CGP (i.e., the person who must sign the NOI form before it is submitted to EPA) must, in accordance with 40 CFR 122.22, be one of the following:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;For a corporation: A responsible corporate officer, which means: (i) a president, secretary, treasurer, or vice-president of the corporation in charge of a principal business function, or any other person who performs similar policy- or decision-making functions for the corporation, or (ii) the manager of one or more manufacturing, production, or operating facilities, provided, the manager is authorized to make management decisions which govern the operation of the regulated facility including having the explicit or implicit duty of making major capital investment recommendations, and initiating and directing other comprehensive measures to assure long term environmental compliance with environmental laws and regulations; the manager can ensure that the necessary systems are established or actions taken to gather complete and accurate information for permit application requirements; and where authority to sign documents has been assigned or delegated to the manager in accordance with corporate procedures.&lt;/li&gt;
						&lt;li&gt;For a partnership or sole proprietorship: A general partner or the proprietor, respectively.&lt;/li&gt;
						&lt;li&gt;For a municipality, state, federal, or other public agency: By either a principal executive officer or ranking elected official. A principal executive officer of a federal agency includes (i) the chief executive officer of the agency, or (ii) a senior executive officer having responsibility for the overall operations of a principal geographic unit of the agency (e.g., Regional Administrator of EPA).&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that the certifier cannot use an authorized representative to certify the EPA CGP NOI form.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p class=&quot;pagetop&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#main-content&quot;&gt;Top of Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-3-10&quot;&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;SWPPPs, inspection reports, corrective action reports, and other permit documents can be signed by the NOI signer/certifier (&lt;a href=&quot;#pane3-9&quot;&gt;see Q&amp;amp;A above&lt;/a&gt;), or by a “duly authorized representative” of the person authorized to sign/certify the NOI, pursuant to 40 CFR 122.22(b) and &lt;a href=&quot;/npdes/epas-2012-construction-general-permit-cgp-and-related-documents&quot;&gt;Appendix I&lt;/a&gt;, Section I.11.2 of the 2012 EPA CGP. A duly authorized representative may only sign these documents if:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The authorization specifies either an individual or a position having responsibility for the overall operation of the regulated facility or activity such as the position of plant manager, operator of a well or a well field, superintendent, position of equivalent responsibility, or an individual or position having overall responsibility for environmental matters for the company. (A duly authorized representative may thus be either a named individual or any individual occupying a named position.); and&lt;/li&gt;
						&lt;li&gt;The signed and dated written authorization is included in the SWPPP. A copy must be submitted to EPA, if requested, pursuant to 40 CFR 122.22(c) and &lt;a href=&quot;/npdes/epas-2012-construction-general-permit-cgp-and-related-documents&quot;&gt;Appendix I&lt;/a&gt;, Section I.11.2.3 of the 2012 EPA CGP.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The duly authorized representative cannot be a subcontractor or third party. The subcontractor or third party may develop the SWPPP, and may conduct inspections and corrective actions and complete reports, but the actual signature must be made by the NOI signer/certifier or a duly authorized representative of a person authorized to sign/certify the NOI.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-3-11&quot;&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;Modifications to your NOI are required any time there is a change to the information submitted on your NOI form. These changes must be made using the eNOI system, unless the EPA Regional Office has previously given you approval to file a paper NOI. If you were given approval by the EPA Regional Office to submit a paper NOI form, you may use &lt;a href=&quot;/npdes/format-submitting-modifications-2012-cgp-noi&quot;&gt;this suggested format to submit modifications to your NOI&lt;/a&gt;. Note that if you will be increasing your disturbed acreage by one or more acres, or if you will be changing the endangered species or historic property eligibility selection on your NOI form, the changes to your form will be subject to the 14-day review process. During this review process, you may continue to operate in a manner that is consistent with your original NOI (e.g., if you originally indicated a disturbance of five acres, but have expanded your operations to include an additional three acres, you may continue to operate on the original five acres that was listed on your original NOI form), but you must wait until the 14-day review process has ended before operating consistent with your modified NOI, unless EPA notifies you that your authorization to operate in accordance with the changes to your NOI has been delayed or denied.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;If you are using the eNOI system to modify any of these sections, a new “Working Copy” of your NOI form will be generated. The Working Copy will be reviewed for 14 days, during which time your original NOI will remain active. The Working Copy will appear in the eNOI application as “[YOUR PERMIT TRACKING NUMBER_Working Copy”. After the 14-day review period, provided EPA has not delayed or denied the modifications, the working copy will replace the original NOI and the permit tracking number will revert to the original tracking number.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-3-12&quot;&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;Yes, once all of the construction activities included in the original NOI are eligible for termination of coverage under Part 8 of the EPA CGP, then the operator may submit the NOT in accordance with the permit. However, if portions of the common plan project that are described by the operator in the original NOI are eligible for termination, but other portions are still undergoing active construction or are yet to be started, then the operator must wait until all permitted portions of the project are completed before submitting the NOT.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-3-13&quot;&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;In the 2012 EPA CGP, you can terminate permit coverage as soon final stabilization has been achieved on all areas not covered by permanent structures for which you are an operator, provided you have met the other requirements for terminating coverage. For the purpose of this discussion, “permanent structure” is used not only in the more traditional sense of “buildings,” but to refer also to other things built on the ground whose intended purpose would require it to remain in a non-vegetated condition after construction has ended (e.g., parking lots, roads, gravel equipment pads, sidewalks, runways). The permit specifies that final stabilization be achieved through vegetative or non-vegetative measures.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Final vegetative stabilization means that vegetation has been established, or for arid or semiarid areas, will be established, that provides a uniform (e.g., evenly distributed, without large bare areas) perennial vegetative cover with a density of 70 percent of the natural background vegetative cover. Perennial vegetation could include grasses, ground covers, trees, shrubs, etc. Vegetative final stabilization requires getting to at least 70 percent of the density of coverage that was provided by vegetation prior to commencing earth-disturbing activities. If prior to construction the natural cover on your site is 50 percent of the site, you would be required to return the site to 35 percent cover (70 percent of 50 percent). For arid, semi-arid, or drought-stricken areas, where the environmental threat is lower, final stabilization is considered to have been met if the area you have seeded or planted will within three years provide established vegetation that covers 70 percent or more of the density of vegetation prior to commencing earth-disturbing activities. In addition to seeding or planting the area to be vegetatively stabilized in arid and semi-arid areas, to the extent necessary to prevent erosion on the seeded or planted area, you must select, design, and install non-vegetative erosion controls that provide cover for at least three years without active maintenance by you. Non-vegetative erosion controls in this context include what are known as “temporary degradable rolled erosion control products,” a.k.a., “erosion control blankets” (ECBs).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Final non-vegetative stabilization means that non-vegetative stabilization methods have been implemented to provide effective cover for exposed portions of the site. Examples include, but are not limited to, rip-rap, gravel, gabions, and geotextiles.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p class=&quot;pagetop&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#main-content&quot;&gt;Top of Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-3-14&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;What if the operator(s) changes before the project is completed?&lt;/a&gt;
				&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-3-14&quot;&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;If operational control changes, the old operator submits a Notice of Termination (NOT) and the new operator submits a Notice of Intent (NOI) before taking over operational control.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In many instances, operational control changes, but only for a portion of the site. In these instances, the new operator must:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;submit an NOI because their site is part of a larger common plan; and&lt;/li&gt;
						&lt;li&gt;develop their own SWPPP or adopt the SWPPP of the previous owner if it&#039;s still applicable (revisions are likely to be necessary to update the explanations of the operators and BMPs - BMPs that were designed for site grading and utility installation for the overall project (e.g., perimeter controls) may not be adequate for the single &quot;big box&quot; or home site.&lt;/li&gt;

				&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-4-1&quot;&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;EPA finalized the Effluent Limitations Guidelines and New Source Performance Standards for the construction and development industry (i.e., the C&amp;amp;D rule) on December 1, 2009. The C&amp;amp;D rule became effective on February 1, 2010, after which all NPDES construction stormwater permits are required to incorporate the C&amp;amp;D rule requirements. EPA’s 2012 CGP includes language that implements the C&amp;amp;D rule requirements. EPA later amended the C&amp;amp;D rule in March 2014, after which all new or re-issued NPDES construction stormwater permits must incorporate the C&amp;amp;D rule requirements, as amended.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-4-2&quot;&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;The requirements in the C&amp;amp;D rule include a suite of non-numeric effluent limitations that apply to all permitted construction sites. (See 40 CFR 450.21.) The non-numeric effluent limits include requirements for:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Erosion and Sediment Controls;&lt;/li&gt;
						&lt;li&gt;Soil Stabilization;&lt;/li&gt;
						&lt;li&gt;Dewatering;&lt;/li&gt;

				&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-4-3&quot;&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;The 2012 EPA CGP includes a number of new provisions implementing the C&amp;amp;D rule, as well as other provisions that provide enhanced protections for impaired or other sensitive waters. In addition, the permit has been modified from the existing 2008 permit to improve its readability and clarity.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Some of the significant permit modifications in the 2012 EPA CGP include new terms and conditions related to:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Emergency-related construction eligibility;&lt;/li&gt;
						&lt;li&gt;Use of cationic treatment chemicals;&lt;/li&gt;
						&lt;li&gt;Increased usage of the electronic Notice of Intent process;&lt;/li&gt;

		&lt;ul class=&quot;accordion&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-5-1&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;Do I have flexibility in preparing the Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) and selecting best management practices (BMPs) for my site?&lt;/a&gt;

				&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-5-1&quot;&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;Stormwater pollution prevention plan requirements were designed to allow maximum flexibility to develop the needed stormwater controls based on the specifics of the site. Some of the factors you might consider include: more stringent local development requirements and/or building codes; precipitation patterns for the area at the time the project will be underway; soil types; slopes; layout of structures for the site; sensitivity of nearby water bodies; safety concerns of the stormwater controls (e.g., potential hazards of water in stormwater retention ponds to the safety of children; the potential of drawing birds to retention ponds and the hazards they pose to aircraft); and coordination with other site operators.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The approach and BMPs used for controlling pollutants in stormwater discharges from small construction sites may vary from those used for large sites since their characteristics can differ in many ways. Operators of small sites may have more limited access to qualified design personnel and technical information. Sites may also have less space for installing and maintaining certain BMPs. A number of structural BMPs (mulching, use of inlet protection, or silt fence) and non-structural BMPs (minimizing disturbance, good housekeeping) have been shown to be efficient, cost effective, and versatile for small construction site operators to implement. As is the case with large construction sites, erosion and sediment control at small construction sites is best accomplished with proper planning, installation, and maintenance of controls.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p class=&quot;pagetop&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#main-content&quot;&gt;Top of Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-5-2&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;Must every permittee have his or her own separate SWPPP or is a joint plan allowed?&lt;/a&gt;
				&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-5-2&quot;&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;The only requirement is that there be at least one SWPPP for a site that incorporates the required elements for all operators, but there can be separate plans if individual permittees so desire. EPA encourages permittees to explore possible cost savings by having a joint SWPPP for several operators. For example, the prime developer could assume the inspection responsibilities for the entire site, while each homebuilder shares in the installation and maintenance of sediment traps serving common areas.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p class=&quot;pagetop&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#main-content&quot;&gt;Top of Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-5-3&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;What are the new buffer requirements in the 2012 EPA CGP and how do I determine my requirements?&lt;/a&gt;
				&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-5-3&quot;&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;The C&amp;amp;D rule includes a non-numeric effluent limitation to “provide and maintain natural buffers, unless infeasible”. However, it does not specify what size buffer is necessary to meet the requirement, but rather leaves this and other related determinations up to the NPDES permitting authority. In drafting the requirements for the 2012 EPA CGP, EPA felt it was reasonable to add specificity to the C&amp;amp;D rule buffer requirement to ensure consistent implementation where EPA is the permitting authority.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;To provide maximum flexibility for permittees, EPA developed buffer compliance alternatives in the 2012 CGP. One compliance alternative allows permittees to provide a minimum undisturbed natural buffer width of 50 feet between the site’s disturbances and any surface waters occurring within 50 feet of the construction site. Alternatively, the permittee can choose to establish a smaller buffer or no buffer, if establishing a buffer is infeasible, as long as other controls are implemented that ensure that the equivalent level of sediment load reduction is achieved as a 50-foot natural buffer. EPA has also established more flexible compliance alternatives for linear facilities and for small residential lots. To learn more about EPA’s buffer requirements and how to comply with them, see the &lt;a href=&quot;/npdes/epas-2012-construction-general-permit-cgp-and-related-documents&quot;&gt;fact sheet&lt;/a&gt; for the permit and the &lt;a href=&quot;/npdes/epas-2012-construction-general-permit-cgp-and-related-documents&quot;&gt;buffer appendix&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p class=&quot;pagetop&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#main-content&quot;&gt;Top of Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-5-4&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;If there is no existing or limited natural vegetation in the 50-foot buffer area between the surface water and my site’s disturbances, do I need to comply with the buffer requirements?&lt;/a&gt;
				&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-5-4&quot;&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;If the 50-foot area between your site’s disturbances and the surface water (i.e., the buffer area) is completely occupied by preexisting development disturbances (e.g., impervious cover), EPA would consider there to be no preexisting natural buffer area on your site and would consider it infeasible to provide and maintain a natural buffer, and you would be exempt from the buffer requirements in the EPA CGP. For example, the buffer requirements would not apply if a waterfront promenade completely occupied the 50-foot buffer area.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For any buffer areas that are only partially occupied by preexisting development disturbances, the buffer requirements in the EPA CGP do apply. The buffer requirements also apply to areas in the 50-foot buffer where natural vegetation is limited or nonexistent (e.g., rocky or sandy areas) and that are otherwise not occupied by preexisting development disturbances.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;For any natural buffer areas on your site with limited vegetation or where there are preexisting development disturbances partially occupying the area, the permit does not require that the natural buffer area in existence be enhanced (e.g., through establishment of new vegetation). Compliance can be achieved simply by retaining and protecting from construction activities the natural buffer that existed prior to the commencement of construction. Or, if you will be conducting new disturbances within the 50-foot buffer area, to comply with the permit you would only be required to compensate for the loss in buffer sediment removal function resulting from your project’s new disturbances; you do not have to compensate for the preexisting development disturbances. EPA provides an example for how this calculation could be done in Attachment 3 of &lt;a href=&quot;/npdes/epas-2012-construction-general-permit-cgp-and-related-documents&quot;&gt;Appendix G&lt;/a&gt; (see Example 2).&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p class=&quot;pagetop&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#main-content&quot;&gt;Top of Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-5-5&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;Is there any flexibility in applying the buffer requirements for small residential lots?&lt;/a&gt;
				&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-5-5&quot;&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;Yes. In issuing the 2012 EPA CGP, EPA recognized that operators on small residential lots (i.e., lots being developed for residential purposes that will disturb less than one acre of land, but are part of a larger residential project that will ultimately disturb greater than or equal to one acre) that are constructing within the 50-foot buffer area may, due to limited technical resources, have difficulty determining the necessary supplemental erosion and sediment controls to provide the equivalent sediment removal function of a 50-foot buffer. Because of this, and due to the lower risk of sediment discharge from these sites, EPA provides in the permit two streamlined compliance options to assist operators of small residential lots in meeting the permit’s buffer requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The first compliance option identifies the minimum specific controls that an operator of a small residential lot would need to implement based on the buffer width to be retained. For example, Small Residential Lot Compliance Alternative 1 specifies that, if you retain a buffer width of 30 feet or fewer, you would need to provide the following: (1) a double row of perimeter controls between the disturbed portion of your site and the surface water spaced a minimum of five (5) feet apart, and (2) completion of stabilization within seven (7) calendar days of the temporary or permanent cessation of earth-disturbing activities.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The second compliance alternative specifies the controls the operator of the small lot would need to implement based on both the buffer width to be retained and the site’s relative risk of sediment discharge. Operators on small lots must first determine their site’s sediment risk level (i.e., High, Moderate, or Low) based on their location, soil type, and slope using the tables provided in &lt;a href=&quot;/npdes/epas-2012-construction-general-permit-cgp-and-related-documents&quot;&gt;Appendix G&lt;/a&gt;. Based on the site’s risk level and the width of buffer to be retained, Small Residential Lot Compliance Alternative 2 then specifies the controls to be implemented. For example, if your site is of “Moderate” sediment discharge risk and you are able to retain a 35-foot buffer, you would be required to provide a double row of perimeter controls between the disturbed portion of your site and the surface water spaced a minimum of five (5) feet apart. See &lt;a href=&quot;/npdes/epas-2012-construction-general-permit-cgp-and-related-documents&quot;&gt;Appendix G&lt;/a&gt; for details about these compliance alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-5-6&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;Is there any flexibility in applying the buffer requirements to linear construction projects?&lt;/a&gt;
				&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-5-6&quot;&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;Yes. EPA recognizes that dispersal of stormwater discharges through adjacent vegetation is a common practice on many linear project sites, and therefore EPA believes that operators of linear projects will in many cases find it feasible to treat stormwater discharges through vegetated buffers. However, EPA recognizes that linear projects may have difficulty in fully complying with each of the compliance alternatives due to site constraints (i.e., linear projects may not be able to provide the full 50-foot naturally vegetated buffer width). For this reason, EPA has provided a more flexible alternative to the buffer compliance alternatives in the 2012 EPA CGP. The permit requires operators of linear construction projects to retain as much natural buffer as feasible, and/or to the extent feasible provide supplemental erosion and sediment controls in the buffer area. For example, if a linear project has only ten feet of right-of-way between the disturbed area and a stream, permit compliance can be achieved by providing a ten-foot natural buffer, or by providing a narrower buffer (e.g., five feet) and additional erosion and sediment controls (e.g., a fiber roll barrier in addition to the perimeter control), or by providing exclusively erosion and sediment controls. Note that operators must document in their SWPPP their rationale as to why it is infeasible to comply with the buffer requirements in Part 2.1.2.1.a, and describe any buffer width retained and/or supplemental erosion and sediment controls installed.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-5-7&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;For linear utility projects, in areas where perimeter controls are not practicable or, alternatively, not necessary, can the operator document this fact in its SWPPP and proceed without installing such controls in those areas?&lt;/a&gt;
				&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-5-7&quot;&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;Part 2.1.2.2.a of the 2012 EPA CGP requires sediment controls (e.g., filter berms, silt fences, temporary diversion dikes) to be installed along those perimeter areas of the site that will receive stormwater from earth-disturbing activities. The purpose of this requirement is to prevent sediment and any other pollutants from being discharged from construction sites into streams, lakes, or other waterbodies.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;To clarify this requirement for the purpose of answering the question, Part 2.1.2.2.a only applies to perimeter areas of the construction site that receive stormwater from the earth-disturbing activity. If a portion of the construction site’s perimeter area does not receive stormwater from earth-disturbing activities, perimeter controls would not be required in that portion of the site. Therefore, perimeter controls would not be necessary in the perimeter area surrounding construction activities in areas of sites where no new earth-disturbing activities occur, which could include:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pole sites where only overhead work is conducted;&lt;/li&gt;
						&lt;li&gt;Use of pre-existing access roads or pad areas where no expansion or below-grade improvements (e.g., no new earth disturbances) will occur; and&lt;/li&gt;
						&lt;li&gt;Areas where vegetation is left in place but needs to be trimmed (e.g., mowing, weed whacking, etc.) to allow temporary access (e.g., overland travel) or use of a site (e.g., wire stringing site). In such circumstances, the ground cover (i.e., grasses and other low-growing vegetation, such as mosses, ferns, vines, shrubs, herbaceous plants, and root mats that are planted or that naturally occur) is retained and no grading occurs.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, if stormwater does flow from small earth-disturbing activities associated with linear utility projects (e.g., utility pole setting) to perimeter areas of the site, but due to the nature of the site and the existing practices in place, construction-related pollutants are prevented from reaching those perimeter areas (e.g., the minimal scope of the disturbance, the implementation of controls that keep the ground stabilized and avoid erosion and sedimentation, and the nature of the surrounding area), then the requirement to install sediment controls in the perimeter area as required in Part 2.1.2.2.a will be satisfied. The following example illustrates site-specific conditions and practices that, should they occur in select areas of a small linear utility project, may make it unnecessary to install additional sediment controls along perimeter areas of the site because any discharge of construction-related pollutants will have been prevented:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Soil disturbances are limited to the setting of the utility pole. Overland travel is used to access the site and, where necessary, vegetation is trimmed, but ground cover is retained and no grading or other earth disturbance occurs;&lt;/li&gt;
						&lt;li&gt;The area surrounding the pole is completely vegetated and is left intact during construction, has a low grade, and is not located close (e.g., within 100 feet) to a water of the U.S. or any stormwater conveyance; and/or&lt;/li&gt;
						&lt;li&gt;Practices are implemented that prevent construction-related pollutants from reaching perimeter areas. Examples of practices could include, but are not limited to, the following:
							&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Construction takes place on a day when no precipitation occurs;&lt;/li&gt;
								&lt;li&gt;Areas surrounding the pole (e.g., 10-foot radius around the pole) that are disturbed are compacted or temporary stabilization is used (e.g., matting, erosion control blankets, geotextile or plastic cover); and&lt;/li&gt;
								&lt;li&gt;The soil removed from the utility pole hole is stockpiled and covered during construction. After the pole is set and soil from the hole is used for backfilling the new pole, excess soil is used in other portions of the project with proper controls or is hauled off-site.&lt;/li&gt;
							&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part 2.1.2.2.a of the 2012 EPA CGP also specifies that “for linear projects with rights-of-way that restrict or prevent the use of such perimeter controls, [the construction operator] must maximize the use of these controls where practicable and document in [the] SWPPP why it is impracticable in other areas of the project.” EPA established this provision in order to recognize that for some linear projects, the available space to install perimeter controls can be restricted, thereby making the installation of perimeter controls in those areas not practicable. Therefore, in applicable portions of the site affected by these types of constraints, the EPA CGP requires that the operator maximize the use of these controls where practicable and document why it is impracticable in other areas of the project in the SWPPP. For example, in urban areas where, due to right-of-way limitations, perimeter controls could cause a safety hazard to vehicles and/or pedestrians, perimeter controls may not be practicable.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;While perimeter controls may not be practicable in the above circumstances, operators are reminded of the requirement under Part 2.1.1.2.a of the EPA CGP to account for the required design factors for their stormwater controls and their overall obligation in Part 2 to minimize sediment discharges. In addition, the operator must ensure that sediment and other pollutants, which may escape the area of disturbance onto off-site streets, other paved areas, and sidewalks, are removed consistent with the mitigation requirements in Part 2.1.2.3.d.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p class=&quot;pagetop&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#main-content&quot;&gt;Top of Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-5-8&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;Part 2.1.2.3.b of the 2012 EPA CGP requires operators to “use appropriate stabilization techniques at all points that exit onto paved roads so that sediment removal occurs prior to vehicle exit.” CGP Part 2.1.2.3.c also requires operators to, “where necessary, use additional controls to remove sediment from vehicle tires prior to exit.” Is there any flexibility in the application of these requirements to linear utility projects, where such stabilization is not appropriate and/or additional controls are not necessary to minimize sediment discharges?&lt;/a&gt;
				&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-5-8&quot;&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;The 2012 EPA CGP requires that all operators restrict vehicle use to properly designated exits, use appropriate stabilization techniques, use additional controls where necessary, and remove sediment that is tracked-out in accordance with Part 2.1.2.3.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;EPA acknowledges that the use of exit points for certain narrow linear utility projects can differ from traditional residential or commercial construction projects, where the same exit points are consistently used throughout the life of a project. Linear utility project disturbances, which include natural gas and electric transmission lines, typically consist of multiple disconnected areas of disturbance associated with access roads, stringing pull stations, laydown/staging yards, and pads. Because exit point stabilization is only required for points that exit onto paved roads, it will often be the case that exit point stabilization and the other track-out controls described in Parts 2.1.2.3.b and 2.1.2.3.c of the 2012 EPA CGP will not be required for linear utility projects that use existing unpaved roads to exit their work locations. However, to the extent that any sediment is tracked from existing access points onto paved roads, the requirement to remove tracked-out sediment in Part 2.1.2.3.d still applies.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Linear utility projects are also often constructed in phases with different access points corresponding to different phases or separate work locations within each phase. When access points are created for linear utility projects, they are often constructed as short ingress/egress locations from nearby existing roads, and are often used episodically and only for very short durations over the life of the project. Therefore, the types of exit point stabilization and other controls that are appropriate for these types of access points may differ from construction projects where access points are used more heavily and consistently throughout the life of the project. Examples of exit point stabilization techniques and controls that may be appropriate for access points that are used episodically and only for very short durations by such linear utility projects could include, but are not limited to, the following:&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Using scheduling techniques to prevent the use of exit points during wet periods;&lt;/li&gt;
						&lt;li&gt;Minimizing exit point use by keeping vehicles onsite to the maximum extent possible;&lt;/li&gt;
						&lt;li&gt;Limiting exit point size to the width needed for vehicle usage and using scarifying and compaction techniques on the soil;&lt;/li&gt;
						&lt;li&gt;Using woody vegetation chips from the clearance of shrubs and trees on the exit point surface;&lt;/li&gt;
						&lt;li&gt;Avoiding locating exit points in environmentally sensitive areas (e.g., wetlands, karst areas, steep slopes); and&lt;/li&gt;
						&lt;li&gt;Conducting routine inspections (e.g., daily on scheduled work days) at exit points to assess the need to implement the mitigation measures in Part 2.1.2.3.d.&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exit point stabilization techniques must be selected to ensure that sediment track-out is minimized. To the extent that any sediment is tracked from the existing access point onto paved roads, all operators must ensure that it is removed consistent with the mitigation requirements in Part 2.1.2.3.d (e.g., sweeping, shoveling, vacuuming, or other similar means). For all projects, the exit point stabilization and controls must be selected based on site-specific conditions to meet the overall requirement in Part 2.1.2.3 to minimize sediment track-out, and must take into account safety considerations. The controls that are selected must also be documented in the SWPPP.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-5-9&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;Why do I have to obtain specific authorization to use cationic treatment chemicals in the 2012 EPA CGP?&lt;/a&gt;
				&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-5-9&quot;&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;A common theme among the comments received on the proposed permit’s requirement regarding treatment chemicals was that EPA should take extreme precaution when authorizing the use of cationic chemicals under the 2012 EPA CGP, especially in light of data suggesting that they are acutely toxic to aquatic species and the fact that the use of such chemicals on construction sites is very different from their use in highly engineered systems for water or wastewater treatment. In response to the comments received on the use of these chemicals, EPA conducted additional research regarding the relative toxicity of cationic chemicals for aquatic species. EPA confirmed that cationic chemicals have been found to be acutely toxic to some species. EPA’s research is encapsulated in a memorandum entitled “Literature Survey of Polymer Toxicity for Construction General Permit (CGP) Work Group” (Office of Research &amp;amp; Development, November 2011), which is available in the docket for the final permit.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;In addition to the public comments and the Agency’s aquatic toxicity research, EPA also considered approaches that state permitting programs have taken to address cationic treatment chemicals. EPA found that where cationic chemicals are specifically addressed, the use of these chemicals is heavily conditioned. These considerations have led EPA to the conclusion that the use of cationic treatment chemicals at construction sites is best managed if its proposed use is subject to a greater degree of individualized review. For that reason, EPA has provided for site-specific authorization if a site intends to use cationic treatment chemicals during construction. In authorizing the use of such chemicals, EPA may impose additional requirements in order to ensure that discharges do not cause or contribute to an exceedance of water quality standards.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;The 2012 EPA CGP authorizes the use of anionic polymers, flocculants, or other treatment chemicals at sites provided operators using such measures comply with the requirements in Part 2.1.3.3 of the permit. Sites that plan to use cationic treatment chemicals are only eligible for coverage under the 2012 EPA CGP if site-specific EPA authorization is provided; otherwise, an individual permit is required in order to use such chemicals associated with a discharge of pollutants to waters of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-5-10&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;What are the new water quality-based requirements in the 2012 EPA CGP?&lt;/a&gt;
				&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-5-10&quot;&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;The 2012 EPA CGP includes requirements that are intended to protect impaired waters that receive construction site stormwater discharges. Sites that discharge to sediment- or nutrient-impaired waters must comply with more rapid site stabilization requirements and increased site inspections. Sites that discharge to high quality waters (i.e., Tier 2, 2.5, or 3 waters) must also comply with the requirements for more rapid site stabilization and increased site inspections.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p class=&quot;pagetop&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#main-content&quot;&gt;Top of Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-5-11&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;With regard to the requirement to conduct an inspection within 24 hours of the occurrence of a storm event of 0.25 inches or greater, if a project’s normal business hours are Monday through Friday and a storm produces greater than 0.25 inches of rain on a Saturday, would an inspection be required on Monday? Or, would an inspection be required on the non-work day?&lt;/a&gt;
				&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-5-11&quot;&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;The 2012 EPA CGP specifies that inspections are only required during a project’s normal working hours. In addition, the permit explains that “within 24 hours of the occurrence of a storm event” means that an inspection is required within 24 hours once a storm event has produced 0.25 inches of rain, even if the storm event is still continuing. However, the 2012 EPA CGP is not clear as to when an inspection would be required for permittees conducting inspections after a 0.25 inch storm event if the rain volume threshold is reached on a non-working day. It was EPA’s intention that the inspection be conducted on the next work day if the 0.25 inch threshold is reached on a non-work day. Therefore, for the example above, if the storm event occurs on a Saturday, the inspection would be required on Monday, the next work day.&lt;/p&gt;

This waiver is dependent on the time period during which a construction activity takes place, how long it lasts, and the expected rainfall amount and intensity during that time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
				If your project is located in an area where EPA is the permitting authority, your project disturbs less than five acres, and your R-factor is less than five, you can submit a Low Erosivity Waiver (LEW) form via EPA&#039;s CGP electronic notice of intent (eNOI) system.

			&lt;li&gt;For discharges to nonimpaired waters, if an equivalent analysis is developed that determines allocations for the pollutant(s) of concern or that such allocations are not needed to protect water quality. The equivalent analysis must be based on existing in-stream concentrations, expected growth in pollutant concentrations from all sources, and a margin of safety.&lt;/li&gt;

    <description>&lt;p&gt;On December 16, 2016, EPA signed a notice of proposed rulemaking addressing public notification requirements for combined sewer overflow (CSO) discharges to the Great Lakes Basin. The proposed rule would implement Section 425 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016 (Public Law 114113) which requires EPA to work with the Great Lakes states to establish public notification requirements for CSO discharges to the Great Lakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;activities&quot; name=&quot;activities&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Pesticide Activities that Require an NPDES Permit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;accordion&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-1&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;Why are NPDES permits required for pesticide applications?&lt;/a&gt;

		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-1&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Section 301(a) of the Clean Water Act (CWA) prohibits any point source discharge of a pollutant to waters of the United States unless the discharge is in compliance with certain sections of the Act. One way a person may discharge pollutants without violating the Section 301 prohibition is by obtaining authorization under a Section 402 National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The requirement to obtain NPDES permits for point source discharges from pesticide applications to waters of the United States stems from a 2009 decision by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. In its ruling on National Cotton Council, et al. v. EPA, the Court vacated EPA’s 2006 rule which said NPDES permits were not required for discharges of pesticides to waters of the United States for applications of pesticides to, or over, including near such waters when in compliance with the existing label (per the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, or “FIFRA”). In its ruling, the Sixth Circuit determined that (1) biological pesticides and (2) chemical pesticides that leave a residue are pollutants as defined under the CWA and as such are subject to regulations applicable to pollutants. Courts have previously determined that applications of pesticides, such as from nozzles of planes and trucks, irrigation equipment, etc. are point sources. As a result of the Sixth Circuit’s decision, point source discharges to waters of the United States from the application of pesticides require NPDES permits as of October 31, 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-2&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;When are NPDES permits required for pesticide applications?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-2&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;A National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit is required for discharges of pollutants from pesticide applications as of October 31, 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-3&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;Which pesticide application activities require NPDES permits?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-3&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits are required for any point source discharge to waters of the United States from the application of (1) biological pesticides and (2) chemical pesticides that leave a residue. EPA identified four pesticide use patterns that generally include the full range of pesticide application activities that meet this condition, including mosquitoes and other flying insect pests, weeds and algae, animal pests, and forest canopy pests. This includes point source discharges from entities such as irrigation and mosquito control districts, federal, state, and local governments, and for-hire pesticide applicators.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;NPDES permits are not required for non-point source discharges. The Clean Water Act (CWA) also exempts discharges of agricultural stormwater or irrigation return flow from the need for NPDES permits. Furthermore, in promulgating the 2006 NPDES Pesticides Rule, EPA expressly noted that the Rule did not cover applications of pesticides to terrestrial agricultural crops where runoff from the crop, either as irrigation return flow or agricultural stormwater, discharges into waters of the United States. It is important to note that if the pest to be targeted is a distance from waters of the United States, but that application is made such that a portion of the pesticide will be unavoidably deposited to waters of the United States and result in a discharge, an NPDES permit is required.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-4&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;What if the label for a pesticide says it is approved for use in aquatic environments (i.e., use in water)? Do discharges to waters of the United States resulting from these pesticide applications still need an NPDES permit?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-4&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Yes. National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits for pesticide discharges to waters of the United States are required under the Clean Water Act (CWA). In addition to NPDES permits, the user of the pesticide must follow the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) label. The CWA and FIFRA requirements operate independently of each other. This permit does not negate the requirements under FIFRA and its implementing regulations to use registered pesticides consistent with the product’s labeling. Applications in violation of certain FIFRA requirements could also be a violation of the permit and therefore a violation of the CWA (e.g., exceeding label application rates).&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-5&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;What if the label for a pesticide says it is not approved for use in water? Do discharges from these pesticides need an NPDES permit?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-5&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Possibly. Some pesticide labels refer to “water” and not “waters of the United States.” It is possible that some pesticide products that are not approved for use in “water” may result in discharges to waters of the United States. For example, waters of the United States may be dry at the time of pesticide application, and there may be situations where pesticide applications to temporarily dry waters of the United States are performed using pesticides labeled for terrestrial or seasonally-dry use. The National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit requirements apply regardless of whether the waters of the United States are wet or dry at the time of the discharge.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-6&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;Is an NPDES permit required for discharges from pesticides applications that only occur for a short time?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-6&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Yes. All applications of (1) biological pesticides and (2) chemical pesticides that leave a residue, in which applications are made directly to waters of the United States, or where a portion of the pesticide will unavoidably be deposited to waters of the United States, are required to be covered under a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit. The Clean Water Act does not provide EPA with the authority to exclude certain types of discharges from the need to obtain permit coverage, such as small “de minimus” or short-term discharges, discharges from emergency situations (except in very limited circumstances as described in 40 CFR 122.3(d) where discharge is in compliance with the instructions of an On-Scene Coordinator), or discharges to “small” waters of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-7&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;Do any of the following affect whether an NPDES permit is required for my pesticide discharge:&lt;br /&gt;
		a. Method of application (e.g., using hand sprayers, vehicle-mounted tanks with sprayer nozzles, or fixed- or rotary-wing aircrafts, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;
		b. Type of product (e.g., adulticides, larvacides, herbicides, insecticides, piscicides, algaecides, rodenticides, fungicides, etc.); or&lt;br /&gt;
		c. Industry (e.g., utility right-of-way, agricultural, golf course, railroad track maintenance, irrigation control, mosquito control, etc.)?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-7&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;No. National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits are required for any pesticide applications that result in discharges to waters of the United States (unless exempted irrigated return flow or agricultural stormwater), regardless of the method of application, type of product, or industry.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-8&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;Are federal agencies required to obtain NPDES permits for their pesticide applications?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-8&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Yes. For determining the need for National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit coverage, federal agencies are not treated differently than any other discharger and thus are required to obtain NPDES permits for any pesticide applications that result in discharges to waters of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-9&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;Are federal agencies required to obtain an NPDES permit for pesticide applications conducted on federal property but where those applications are operated by a non-federal lessee or similar non-federal party?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-9&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;It depends. The National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) regulations, at 40 CFR §122.21(b), require that when a facility or activity is owned by one entity but operated by another, it is the Operator’s duty to obtain a permit. EPA, in its pesticide general permit (PGP), defines “Operator” as any entity associated with the application of pesticides which results in a discharge to waters of the United States that meets either of the following two criteria: (1) any entity who performs the application of a pesticide or who has day-to-day control of the application (i.e., they are authorized to direct workers to carry out those activities), or (2) any entity with control over the decision to perform pesticide applications including the ability to modify those decisions. Thus, in certain instances, more than one entity may meet the definition of “Operator.” In these instances, each Operator is required to be covered under an NPDES permit.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;If a federal agency leases land to, or enters into a purchase agreement with, another entity (such as for grazing, operating a ski resort, exploring for or producing oil and gas, or managing and harvesting timber), the lessee or purchaser generally is required to obtain an NPDES permit as the “Operator” of those pesticide activities. A possible exception to the lessee/purchaser scenario described above would be if the lease agreement contains specific language imposing pesticide application requirements (i.e., detailing how the lessee is to control pests). Such requirements might also specify the timing of applications, chemical/product types, application rates, or specific weeds or other pests to be controlled on the lease. Such language may indicate that the federal agency is controlling the pesticide application decision, and therefore is an Operator as is the entity who is applying the pesticides.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;EPA, in its PGP, used the terms “Decision-maker” and “Applicator” to assign responsibilities for complying with the permit. The different terms acknowledge the different roles that these two types of Operators play in the process of applying pesticides. By definition, both are required to obtain NPDES permit coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-10&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;How close to waters of the United States do my applications have to be to require an NPDES permit?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-10&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;If a pesticide discharge occurs directly to waters of the United States, a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit is required. If the pest to be targeted is at a distance from waters of the United States, but that application is made such that a portion of the pesticide will be unavoidably deposited to waters of the United States, an NPDES permit is required.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-11&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;How does EPA define “near” waters of the United States?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-11&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Although the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals did not define the term “near” in the context of the 2006 Pesticides Final Rule, EPA interprets this term to refer to the unavoidable discharge of pesticides to waters of the United States in order to target pests in close proximity to but not necessarily in such waters. EPA does not use or define the term “near” in its pesticide general permit or elsewhere in its regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-12&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;Is an NPDES permit required for pesticides applied to waters of the United States that are dry at the time of the discharge?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-12&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Yes. If a permitting authority determines that the pesticide application will indeed result in a discharge to waters of the United States, a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit is required. A water of the United States does not lose its jurisdictional status if it becomes dry during extraordinary circumstances such as drought or if it flows continuously during parts of the year and has no flow during dry months. A discharger will need a permit regardless of whether the waters of the United States are wet, partially wet, or dry at the time of the discharge.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-13&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;How does one determine whether a discharge occurs to waters of the United States?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-13&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The determination of whether a discharge from the application of pesticides requires a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit requires a site-specific evaluation of whether that discharge will be made to (i.e., within the boundary of) “waters of the United States”.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Additional information on EPA’s interpretation and implementation of the term “waters of the United States” can be accessed from EPA’s website. Interested parties may also contact their NPDES permitting authority.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-14&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;Is an NPDES permit required for chemical pesticide applications that do not leave a residue?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-14&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;No. A National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit would not be necessary if it is determined that a residual did not enter waters of the United States. However, if a chemical pesticide is discharged to waters of the United States, any excess pesticides or pesticides that no longer provide any pesticidal benefit that remain in those waters are considered “residual.” Thus, EPA expects that some portion of every pesticide applied to waters of the United States will leave a residual in those waters. As such EPA assumes that every application of chemical pesticides to waters of the United States will trigger the requirement for an NPDES permit.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;EPA recommends that an entity applying chemical pesticides with a discharge to waters of the United States who disagrees with this assumption be able to provide scientific data supporting such a determination. Such data should show what level of the pesticide can be detected in water, and at what level in water the pesticide provides a pesticidal benefit. Such data should address the properties of the chemical pesticide under different water conditions (e.g., different pH, organic content, temperature, depth, etc.) that might affect the pesticide’s properties. A permit would not be necessary if the data indicates that a residual does not enter waters of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-15&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;Are there thresholds for application areas below which an NPDES permit is not required? For example, are Operators exempt from NPDES permitting for pesticides applied below the “annual treatment area threshold” values listed in EPA’s Pesticide General Permit (e.g., 80 acres, 20 linear miles, 6400 acres)?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-15&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;No. The “annual treatment area threshold” values listed in EPA’s Pesticide General Permit (PGP) establish whether or not Operators must submit a Notice of Intent (NOI) to obtain coverage under EPA’s PGP and comply with more comprehensive permit requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-16&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;Did the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals’ decision address pesticide applications made to locations other than to waters of the United States where, for example, other NPDES permits may already exist for discharges from the facility/site?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-16&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;No. Pesticide discharges from industrial operations where pesticides are applied within a facility/site for control of pests within the process/site and then ultimately discharged via end-of-pipe were not part of the National Cotton Council, et al. v. EPA lawsuit or Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals’ decision. National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit coverage has been required for those types of pesticide discharges since the inception of the NPDES program. For example, discharges to waters of the United States from the application of pesticides for the control of zebra mussels within a piped cooling system required NPDES permit coverage prior to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals’ decision. Such is still the case.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-17&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;Does obtaining an NPDES permit expose pesticide applicators to increased legal liabilities?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-17&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;No. In fact, the opposite is true. Any Operator who does not have a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit, and whose application of pesticides results in a discharge to waters of the United States, is discharging illegally and may be in violation of the Clean Water Act. An NPDES permit authorizes the discharge of pollutants provided all of the permit conditions are met, and thus obtaining an NPDES permit and complying with the terms of an NPDES permit actually shields the Operator from liability, including certain forms of third party citizen suit liability.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-18&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;Which government agencies issue NPDES permits for pesticide application point source discharges?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-18&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The Clean Water Act (CWA) establishes a framework that provides that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issues National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits except where a state, territory, or tribe submits a request to EPA (and EPA approves that request) for the state, territory, or tribe to administer the NPDES program in their jurisdiction. Forty-six states and the Virgin Islands have obtained this authority and as such issue NPDES permits. (Note: Alaska and Oklahoma took over permitting pesticide discharges in 2012.) Typically, it is the environmental protection agency in that state (e.g., the department of environmental protection or department of natural resources) that is authorized to issue NPDES permits. In certain instances though, a state or territory may not be fully authorized to issue NPDES permits in all areas or for all activities within their jurisdictional boundaries. In those instances, as well as elsewhere where a state, territory, or tribe has not obtained NPDES authorization, EPA issues the permits. As of 2013, areas where and activities for which EPA is still the authorized NPDES permitting authority for pesticide discharges to waters of the United States are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;All activities, including federal facilities, in:
					&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Idaho&lt;/li&gt;
						&lt;li&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/li&gt;
						&lt;li&gt;New Hampshire&lt;/li&gt;
						&lt;li&gt;New Mexico&lt;/li&gt;
						&lt;li&gt;Washington, DC&lt;/li&gt;
						&lt;li&gt;Puerto Rico and all other U.S. territories except the Virgin Islands&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;All activities on Indian Country nationwide except within the State of Maine&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;All federal facilities in:
					&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Colorado&lt;/li&gt;
						&lt;li&gt;Delaware&lt;/li&gt;
						&lt;li&gt;Vermont&lt;/li&gt;
						&lt;li&gt;Washington&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Activities associated with oil and gas, or geothermal resources, in Texas&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;See EPA’s 2016 PGP, Appendix C for a detailed list of the areas where EPA is the NPDES permitting authority for pesticide discharges to waters of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-19&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;If a federal agency has a decision-making role in the application of pesticides that are covered by this permit, is the area where those activities occur considered part of the “federal facility?”&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-19&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Yes. For purposes of NPDES permit coverage, the term “federal facilities” includes areas of activity where the federal agency is a Decision-maker regardless of whether those pesticide applications are performed on federal lands. However, merely because activities are performed on federal land does not in itself make those areas &quot;federal facilities.&quot; For purposes of this permit, if the federal agency has no involvement in the decision to control pests, then the area where the pesticide application occurs would not be considered a “federal facility.”&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-20&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;If an Operator has discharges in more than one state, what should the Operator do to obtain permit coverage?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-20&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Operators must obtain permit coverage separately for each state where their discharges will occur. For example, if the discharges will occur in Idaho and Wyoming, the Operator must obtain a permit from EPA for the discharges in Idaho (since it is an EPA-administered area), and a permit from Wyoming for the discharges in Wyoming.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;NPDES permits are not required for non-point source discharges. The Clean Water Act (CWA) also exempts discharges of agricultural stormwater or irrigation return flow from the need for NPDES permits. Furthermore, in promulgating the 2006 NPDES Pesticides Rule, EPA expressly noted that the Rule did not cover applications of pesticides to terrestrial agricultural crops where runoff from the crop, either as irrigation return flow or agricultural stormwater, discharges into waters of the United States. It is important to note that if the pest to be targeted is a distance from waters of the United States, but that application is made such that a portion of the pesticide will be unavoidably deposited to waters of the United States and result in a discharge, an NPDES permit is required.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-21&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;Where can an Operator find more information on National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) pesticide permitting in their state?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-21&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Contact your NPDES-authorized state for information on applicable pesticide permitting in your state. Contact information and permitting details for NPDES-authorized states can be accessed at &lt;a href=&quot;/npdes/pesticide-permitting&quot;&gt;EPA&#039;s Pesticide Permitting website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-22&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;If an NPDES-authorized state does not have a general permit for pesticide discharges, what should Operators do to obtain permit coverage?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-22&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;In this instance, the only permitting option available is for the Operator to apply for a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) individual permit by submitting a permit application to the state.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-23&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;Is there a fee for coverage under an NPDES permit?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-23&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;EPA does not charge a fee for applying for or obtaining coverage under any National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit; however, many of the NPDES-authorized states do charge fees for permit applications, Notices of Intent, and/or permit coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-24&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;What types of NPDES permits are available for pesticide applications that result in discharges to waters of the United States? &lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-24&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program provides for two types of permits: individual and general. Permitting authorities may develop general permits in part to reduce administrative burdens associated with individual permits for Operators. Without coverage under a general permit, any pesticide discharge to waters of the United States that requires coverage under an NPDES permit must be covered under an individual permit.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-25&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;What are the primary differences between an NPDES individual permit and an NPDES general permit?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-25&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;A National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) individual permit is written to reflect site-specific conditions of a single discharger (or in rare instances to multiple co-permittees) based on information submitted by that discharger in a permit application and is unique to that discharger whereas an NPDES general permit is written to cover multiple dischargers with similar operations and types of discharges based on the permit writer’s professional knowledge of those types of activities and discharges. Individual permits are issued directly to an individual discharger whereas a general permit is issued to no one in particular with multiple dischargers obtaining coverage under that general permit after it is issued, consistent with the permit eligibility and authorization provisions. As such, dischargers covered under general permits know their applicable requirements before obtaining coverage under that permit. Furthermore, obtaining coverage under a general permit is typically quicker than an individual permit with coverage under a general permit often occurring immediately (depending on how the permit is written) or after a short waiting period. Coverage under an individual permit may take six months or longer.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-26&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;What is the process for applying for coverage under an NPDES general permit?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-26&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) general permits do not require that Operators “apply” for coverage; rather, general permits typically rely on the submission of a document called a Notice of Intent (NOI). An NOI differs from an individual permit application in that it is submitted by Operators after the general permit is issued by the permitting authority. An NOI for a general permit is a notice to the NPDES permitting authority of an Operator’s intent to be covered under a general permit, and typically contains basic information about the Operator and the planned discharge for which coverage is being requested. Some general permits, such as EPA’s Pesticide General Permit, automatically cover some Operator discharges without submission of an NOI. In these instances, Operators must comply with applicable permit requirements for their pesticide applications without submission of any paperwork to the permitting authority (or in some instances, submission of some other type of notification document).&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-27&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;How do Operators apply for coverage under an NPDES individual permit?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-27&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;An Operator must submit a permit application to apply for coverage under a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) individual permit. The application form must be submitted to the permitting authority at least 180 days before the expected commencement of the discharge. NPDES permit application requirements are in Part 122, Subpart B and identified on forms developed by EPA. NPDES-authorized states are not required to use EPA application forms; however, any alternative form used by an NPDES-authorized state must include the federal requirements at a minimum. EPA’s application forms are available at the permit applications and forms page.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-28&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;How are the requirements developed in NPDES permits for pesticide discharges?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-28&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits must contain permit conditions determined necessary to meet the Clean Water Act (CWA) and NPDES regulatory requirements for controlling discharges of pesticides to waters of the United States. For example, EPA’s Pesticide General Permit (PGP) includes both technology-based effluent limitations and water quality-based effluent limitations as necessary, which is consistent with CWA requirements. Since there are no national effluent limitation guidelines for such discharges, EPA developed the PGP’s effluent limitations based on permit writer’s Best Professional Judgment (BPJ) necessary to meet the requirements of the CWA. NPDES permits also contain many other conditions (e.g., monitoring, reporting, recordkeeping) required under the NPDES regulations but based on permit writer’s BPJ specific to these pesticide discharges. In addition, all NPDES permits are required to include “standard conditions” consistent with the regulation requirements in 40 CFR 122.41. NPDES permits issued by NPDES-authorized states are required to follow similar procedures although states may include more stringent requirements consistent with any applicable state laws.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-29&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;Do the NPDES-authorized states need to include requirements to protect endangered species and critical habitat, as EPA’s PGP does?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-29&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;This varies by state. Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973 requires all federal agencies to ensure, in consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) (together, the “Services”), that any federal action carried out by any agency is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species (together, “listed” species), or result in the adverse modification or destruction of habitat of such species that is designated by the Services as critical (“critical habitat”). See 16 U.S.C. 1536(a)(2), 50 CFR 402. EPA’s issuance of the Pesticide General Permit (PGP) is a federal action requiring such consultation. Section 7 of the ESA does not apply to NPDES-authorized states for issuance of their National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits; although a number of states have adopted procedures to evaluate listed species and their critical habitat consistent with federal procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;eligibility&quot; name=&quot;eligibility&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Eligibility Criteria for EPA&#039;s Pesticide General Permit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;accordion&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-30&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;What is EPA’s Pesticide General Permit?&lt;/a&gt;

		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-30&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The Pesticide General Permit (PGP) is an EPA-issued National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) general permit that became effective beginning October 31, 2016. EPA’s PGP provides a means by which Operators can seek NPDES permit coverage for discharge to waters of the United States that result from the application of pesticides. Specifically, the permit is available in areas where EPA is the permitting authority. Without the availability of an NPDES general permit, such Operators would be required to obtain coverage under a more administratively burdensome NPDES &lt;em&gt;individual&lt;/em&gt; permit..&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-31&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;What types of discharges are eligible for EPA’s PGP?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-31&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;EPA’s Pesticide General Permit (PGP) is available for Operators who apply (1) biological pesticides or (2) chemical pesticides that leave a residue, either of which result in point source discharges to waters of the United States, from the following pesticide use patterns:&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mosquito and other flying insect pest control;&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Weed and algae control;&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Animal pest control; and&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Forest canopy pest control.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PGP includes additional eligibility criteria, although those criteria are mostly for infrequent situations. EPA has developed a step-by-step, interactive, online tool, to help pesticide Operators determine whether they are eligible for EPA’s PGP. The tool is available at &lt;a href=&quot;/npdes/pesticide-permitting&quot;&gt;EPA&#039;s Pesticide Permitting website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-32&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;Is EPA’s PGP available for pesticide applications that result in discharges to impaired waters?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-32&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;In certain instances, coverage under EPA’s Pesticide General Permit (PGP) is not available for discharges to impaired waters. Specifically, the following discharges of pesticides are not authorized for coverage under the PGP:&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;To waters which are impaired for the active ingredient of the pesticide&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;To waters which are impaired for degradates of that active ingredient&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;To waters which are impaired for the class of pesticides (e.g., pyrethroids) to which the pesticide to be applied belongs.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discharges to waters impaired for temperature or some other indicator parameter, or for physical impairments such as “habitat alteration,” are eligible for PGP coverage unless the Operator is otherwise notified by EPA.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;If a discharge is not eligible for coverage under the PGP, Operators must choose between obtaining coverage under an individual permit for such a discharge or selecting some other means of pest management, e.g., using mechanical means or a different pesticide active ingredient.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-33&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;What are “Tier 3 waters” referenced in EPA’s PGP?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-33&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;States, territories, and certain tribes (i.e., those tribes with “treatment as state” status for purposes of water quality standards) are required to adopt appropriate designated uses (i.e., goals) for their waters. Based on those goals, these states, territories, and tribes are required to adopt necessary water quality criteria to protect those designated uses for each of their waters. In addition to establishing designated uses and water quality criteria, these states, territories, and tribes must adopt an anti-degradation policy to help maintain existing water quality and protect high quality waters. That anti-degradation policy is to address three categories:&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tier 1 – for the protection of water quality for existing uses&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Tier 2 – for the protection of high quality waters&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Tier 3 – for the protection of Outstanding National Resource Waters (ONRWs).&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tier 3 waters are identified by the state, territory, or tribe as waters having unique characteristics to be preserved (e.g., waters of exceptional recreational, environmental, or ecological significance). No degradation is allowed in Tier 3 waters except on a short-term or temporary basis, such as weeks or months, rather than years. Of note, many states/tribes have levels of protection that are similarly protective as Tier 3 waters but may allow more flexibility when making water quality determinations. These waters are often called Tier 2½ waters. Examples of such Tier 2½ designations include &quot;Outstanding State Resource Waters,&quot; &quot;Outstanding Natural Resource Waters,&quot; and &quot;Exceptional Waters.&quot; A list of Tier 3 waters in geographic areas covered under EPA’s PGP is available at &lt;a href=&quot;/npdes/pesticide-permitting&quot;&gt;EPA&#039;s Pesticide Permitting website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-34&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;Is EPA’s PGP available for pesticide applications that result in discharges to waters designated as Outstanding National Resource Waters (Tier 3)?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-34&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;EPA’s Pesticide General Permit (PGP) provides coverage for discharges from pesticide applications made to Tier 3 waters. However, this is only for applications made to those waters to restore or maintain water quality or to protect public health or the environment. These applications should not degrade water quality or only degrade water quality on a short-term or temporary basis. A list of Tier 3 waters in geographic areas covered under EPA’s PGP is available at &lt;a href=&quot;/npdes/pesticide-permitting&quot;&gt;EPA&#039;s Pesticide Permitting website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-35&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;EPA’s PGP available for pesticide applications that result in discharges to waters of the United States that are dry at the time when the pesticide applications are actually performed? &lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-35&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Yes. Discharges to waters of the United States, whether wet or dry at the time of application, are required to be covered under a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit and can be covered by EPA’s Pesticide General Permit (PGP), where the PGP is available. As such, these pesticide applications may be performed using pesticides labeled for terrestrial, seasonally-dry, or aquatic uses.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-36&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;Is EPA’s PGP available for pesticide applications that result in discharges to waters of the United States containing endangered species?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-36&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;EPA’s Pesticide General Permit (PGP) is available for Operators who can ensure that pesticide discharges are not likely to adversely affect species that are federally-listed as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), or habitat that is federally-designated as critical under the ESA, with certain exceptions outlined in the permit. This includes listed species and critical habitat managed by both the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS).&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Operators with discharges to waters of the United States containing NMFS Listed Resources of Concern must determine their eligibility for coverage through additional ESA-related criteria outlined in the permit. They must also submit Notice of Intents (NOIs) and annual reports and implement Integrated Pest Management (IPM)-like practices. See Part 1.1.2.4 of EPA’s PGP for more information. Operators with discharges to waters of the United States containing FWS listed species and critical habitats have no additional permit requirements. EPA may, through consultation with FWS, determine that additional permit conditions are necessary and will follow the appropriate measures necessary to achieve this.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-37&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;Does the method of pesticide application affect the determination of whether or not discharges from those applications are eligible for coverage under EPA’s PGP?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-37&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;No. EPA’s Pesticide General Permit (PGP) covers discharges that result from pesticide applications to waters of the United States irrespective of whether the pesticide applications are made by hand sprayers, vehicle-mounted tanks with sprayer nozzles, fixed- or rotary-wing aircrafts, or other types of application methods.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-38&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;Are pesticide activities to control pests along rights-of-ways or similar linear features (e.g., railroad, roadway, utility line) that result in discharges to waters of the United States, eligible for coverage under EPA’s PGP?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-38&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;EPA’s Pesticide General Permit (PGP) is available for discharges from pesticide applications to waters of the United States for purposes of pest control along rights-of-ways or similar linear features for any of the four pesticide use patterns. For example, weed control using herbicides would be covered under the Weed and Algae Pest Control use pattern for those portions of the pest control that result in discharges to waters of the United States. Also, EPA’s PGP is available whether the pesticides are applied aerially or on the ground. Pesticide activities performed along rights-of-ways or similar linear features that do not result in discharges to waters of the United States do not require coverage under a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-39&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;Is pesticide spray drift covered under EPA’s PGP?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-39&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;EPA’s Pesticide General Permit (PGP) does not cover spray drift. Consistent with the 2006 NPDES Pesticides Rule and the 2011 PGP, the 2016 PGP does not cover spray drift resulting from pesticide applications. Instead, to address spray drift, EPA is actively engaged in several initiatives to help minimize pesticide drift problems such as: (1) establishing a new voluntary Pesticide Drift Reduction Technology (DRT) program; (2) evaluating potential for drift as a routine part of pesticides risk assessments; (3) in collaboration with experts, improving scientific models and methods for estimating drift and risks from drift; (4) strengthening labeling for new pesticides and when re-evaluating older pesticides; (improving the clarity and enforceability of product label directions and drift management restrictions; and (5) promoting applicator education and training programs. More information on EPA’s work on reducing pesticide drift is available at https://www.epa.gov/reducing-pesticide-drift. It should also be pointed out that some pesticide applications, such as ultra-low volume (ULV) spraying of mosquito adulticides, are applied as a fog with the intent of the pesticide remaining airborne. EPA does not consider ULV applications to targeted sites to be “spray drift”, and, therefore, ULV applications are eligible for coverage under EPA’s PGP.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-40&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;Are pesticide discharges that are covered under another NPDES permit eligible for coverage under EPA’s PGP?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-40&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;No, discharges already covered under another National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit are not eligible for coverage under EPA’s Pesticide General Permit (PGP). For example, a city may have discharges from pesticide applications already covered under an existing municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) permit. In that instance, those covered discharges would not be eligible for coverage under EPA’s PGP. This includes discharges currently covered under a different NPDES permit as well as discharges from activities where the associated NPDES permit has been or is in the process of being denied, terminated, or revoked by EPA (although this latter provision does not apply to the routine reissuance of permits every five years).&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-41&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;If a pesticide application activity is not eligible for coverage under EPA’s PGP, does this mean an NPDES permit is not required for discharges from those activities?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-41&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Not necessarily. EPA’s Pesticide General Permit (PGP) covers many pesticide application discharges required to obtain a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit in the areas where EPA is the NPDES permitting authority. However, there may still be some pesticide application discharges requiring NPDES permit coverage that are not eligible under EPA’s PGP. For example, pesticide application discharges may already be covered under another NPDES permit. In that case, those discharges would not be eligible for coverage under the PGP, yet still require coverage under another NPDES permit. Similarly, certain discharges of pesticides to Tier 3 waters (i.e., Outstanding National Resource Waters) are not eligible for coverage under the PGP but do still require coverage under an NPDES permit (e.g., an NPDES individual permit).&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;

		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-42&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;No. “Pesticide” is defined in Appendix A of EPA’s Pesticide General Permit (PGP) to include a wide range of products, and includes both FIFRA registered and unregistered products. If a pesticide is being applied for any of the four pesticide use patterns included in the permit, that activity is subject to the requirement for National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit coverage and eligible for coverage under EPA’s PGP. If a pesticide is being applied for a different reason, for example, clove oil being used to stun fish for collection purposes, or alum used to control phosphorus levels in the water as a way to inhibit algae growth (as an algaestat, not as an algaecide), that activity is not eligible for coverage under EPA’s PGP. Pesticide activities not eligible for coverage under EPA’s PGP may require an NPDES individual permit.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-43&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;Is EPA&#039;s PGP available for the use of copper sulfate to control algae in a drinking water source that itself is a water of the United States? &lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-43&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;EPA’s Pesticide General Permit (PGP) is available for those applications unless that waterbody is impaired for copper or sulfate. In that situation, EPA’s PGP is available for application of copper sulfate to control algae for taste and odor control under the weed and algae control pesticide use pattern. Operators wanting to apply copper sulfate to waters of the United States impaired for copper or sulfate must obtain coverage under an NPDES individual permit rather than EPA’s PGP.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-44&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;Is EPA’s PGP available for activities in areas for which an existing Endangered Species Act Section 7 consultation has been completed?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-44&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Yes. Provided all conditions and/or requirements of that consultation that address pesticide application activities covered under EPA’s Pesticide General Permit (PGP) are met, those activities are eligible for coverage under EPA’s PGP. See Part 1.6 of the PGP.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-45&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;Does EPA’s PGP cover pesticide application activities in areas with threatened and endangered species managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) even though EPA has not completed its consultation with the USFWS?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-45&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Yes. EPA’s Pesticide General Permit (PGP) does cover pesticide application activities in areas with threatened and endangered species listed by the USFWS. EPA was able to issue the permit consistent with section 7(d) of the Endangered Species Act because its issuance does not foreclose either the formulation by the Services, or the implementation by EPA, of any alternatives that might be determined in the consultation to be necessary to comply with section 7(a)(2). EPA’s PGP also covers pesticide applications in areas containing threatened and endangered species listed by the National Marine Fisheries Services (NMFS) although the permit includes additional terms for discharges to certain areas with NMFS-listed species and critical habitat.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-46&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;What does it mean to be “covered” under EPA’s PGP? &lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-46&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;EPA uses the term “covered” or “coverage” in the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program to identify Operators’ discharges to waters of the United States that meet all the necessary eligibility and application provisions of an existing NPDES permit and as such are authorized to discharge under the terms and conditions of that permit. For example, a pesticide applicator that is “covered under the Pesticide General Permit (PGP)” has met all eligibility requirements of the permit and is authorized to discharge to waters of the United States consistent with the terms and conditions of the permit.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-47&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;Who is responsible for seeking coverage under the PGP?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-47&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) regulations require that any “person” that discharges pollutants to waters of the United States can do so only under the terms and conditions provided in an NPDES permit. The NPDES regulations define “person” as an “individual, association, partnership, corporation, municipality, state or federal agency, or an agent or employee thereof.” This may include entities such as municipalities responsible for pest control, pest control districts, farmers, for-hire pesticide applicators, etc. Further, the regulations clarify that when an activity is owned by one person but operated by another person, it is the Operator’s duty to obtain a permit. Thus, EPA uses the term “Operator” when describing who is required to obtain NPDES permit coverage. EPA’s Pesticide General Permit (PGP) defines “Operator” to mean any entity associated with the application of pesticides which results in a discharge to waters of the United States that meets either of the following two criteria:&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;any entity who performs the application of a pesticide or who has day-to-day control of the application (i.e., they are authorized to direct workers to carry out those activities); or&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;any entity with control over the decision to perform pesticide applications including the ability to modify those decisions.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the PGP, EPA calls any Operator identified by (i) above an “Applicator” and any Operator identified by (ii) above a “Decision-maker.” Thus, in some instances, there may be more than one Operator responsible for a discharge and as such, more than one Operator required to have coverage under EPA’s PGP. As described elsewhere, even when more than one Operator is responsible for a given discharge, EPA’s PGP never requires more than one Operator to submit a Notice of Intent (NOI) to be covered under the permit. Any other Operators meeting the eligibility requirements of the permit are covered automatically without the need to submit an NOI (or, for that matter, any other application or similar paperwork).&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-48&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;How do Operators obtain coverage under EPA’s PGP? &lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-48&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Operators that meet the eligibility provisions specified in the permit can be covered under the permit in one of two ways. As detailed in EPA’s Pesticide General Permit (PGP), certain Operators are automatically covered under the permit and are authorized to discharge pesticides immediately. Some Operators, namely certain Decision-makers as identified in EPA’s PGP, must submit a Notice of Intent (NOI) to obtain coverage under the permit and are authorized to discharge pesticides at some point in time (generally, 10 to 30 days) after EPA receives such NOI and posts that complete and accurate NOI on the Agency website.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-49&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;Do all Operators have the same requirements under EPA’s PGP?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-49&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;No. EPA’s Pesticide General Permit (PGP) delineates different responsibilities for different types of Operators as well as different types of pesticide application activities and locations of those activities. Decision-makers and Applicators are both Operators and thus in some instances, more than one Operator may be responsible for compliance with the permit for any given pesticide application activity. The permit assigns different responsibilities to Decision-makers and Applicators; although any Operator covered under the permit is still responsible, jointly and severally, for any violation associated with its discharges.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-50&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;What is the difference between an Applicator and a Decision-maker?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-50&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;For purposes of EPA’s Pesticide General Permit (PGP), an Applicator is an entity who performs the application of a pesticide, or who has day-to-day control of the application (i.e., they are authorized to direct workers to carry out those activities). A Decision-maker is an entity with control over the decision to perform pesticide applications, including the ability to modify those decisions. A Decision-maker, for example, is the entity that hires a pesticide application company to apply pesticides or instructs its own staff to apply pesticides. Decision-makers and Applicators are both Operators and thus in some instances, more than one Operator may be responsible for compliance with the permit for any given pesticide application activity.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-51&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;If an agency leases land to another entity, and applicators are hired to perform pest control activities on that land, who is the Decision-maker?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-51&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;An entity is unlikely to be a Decision-maker if it owns the land but the pesticide application activities are being performed without its input or control (e.g., a private party is spraying for weeds on public lands that the private party leases from the federal government). In this scenario, the lessee is the Decision-maker.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-52&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;If an agency provides funds for pest control activities on private lands, is the agency a Decision-maker? &lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-52&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;An agency is not considered a Decision-maker if it does not have control over the decision to perform pest control activities. Merely providing funds for such an activity is not considered to be a Decision-making activity. The entity who authorizes the pest control activities is the Decision-maker.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-53&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;What is the procedure for obtaining coverage under EPA’s PGP? &lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-53&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Certain dischargers of pesticides must submit a Notice of Intent (NOI) to be authorized to discharge under EPA’s Pesticide General Permit (PGP). The NOI form is a short document requesting basic information about the nature of the activities under consideration. Many other dischargers are covered under EPA’s PGP without submission of an NOI, or for that matter, any type of documentation (e.g., a permit application).&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-54&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;What does submittal of an NOI mean?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-54&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;A Notice of Intent (NOI) for a general permit is similar to a permit application, in that it is notification to the regulatory authority of a planned discharge for which coverage under a specific National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) general permit is needed and contains information about the discharge and the Operator of that discharge. The NOI serves as the Operator’s notice to the permitting authority that the Operator intends for the discharge to be authorized under the terms and conditions of that general permit. By signing and submitting the NOI, the Operator is certifying that the discharge meets all of the eligibility conditions specified in the general permit (e.g., that a pesticide discharge management plan has been developed if necessary) and that the Operator intends to follow the terms and conditions of the permit. A fraudulent or erroneous NOI invalidates permit coverage. An incomplete NOI delays permit coverage until such time as the NOI has been completed.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-55&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;Who must submit an NOI to obtain permit coverage under EPA’s PGP?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-55&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Certain Decision-makers, as defined in Appendix A of EPA’s Pesticide General Permit (PGP), must submit Notice of Intents (NOIs). See Table 1-1 of the PGP for identification of Decision-makers required to submit NOIs. EPA has developed an interactive web tool to assist Operators in determining their requirements under the PGP, including whether or not they need to submit an NOI. The tool is available at &lt;a href=&quot;/npdes/pesticide-permitting&quot;&gt;EPA&#039;s Pesticide Permitting website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;

		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-56&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;If the NOI is submitted electronically, the system will provide an immediate email confirmation to the certifying official that the NOI was received. EPA will provide separate notification within 30 days whether coverage has been granted or if further review is required. The status of a pending NOI can also be viewed on the eNOI Search tool at &lt;a href=&quot;/npdes/pesticide-permitting&quot;&gt;EPA&#039;s Pesticide Permitting website&lt;/a&gt;. If the NOI is submitted in paper form, EPA will not provide confirmation of receipt. EPA will only provide direct notification of whether coverage has been granted or if further review is required. As soon as EPA processes a paper NOI the NOI status can be viewed on the eNOI Search tool.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;

How do Decision-makers determine whether or not waters of the United States contain NMFS Listed Resources of Concern? &lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-57&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/npdes/pesticide-permitting&quot;&gt;EPA&#039;s Pesticide Permitting website&lt;/a&gt; provides information to help Operators comply with the requirements of EPA’s Pesticide General Permit (PGP). One of the tabs on the page is to “ESA Procedures.” That webpage contains maps, tables, descriptions, etc. of the species and locations of concern to NMFS for EPA’s PGP.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-58&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Where an applicator is hired or authorized by an entity to perform pest control activities, the applicator is not considered a “Decision-maker” and therefore is not required to submit a Notice of Intent (NOI).&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-59&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;What are the requirements under EPA’s PGP for an Operator who is eligible for EPA’s PGP, but is not required to submit an NOI?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-59&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Under the PGP, an Operator who is not required to submit an NOI is subject to fewer requirements than an Operator who is required to submit an NOI. Each part or subpart of the permit clarifies whether requirements in that part or subpart apply only to Operators required to submit an NOI or some other subset of Operators (for example, “all Operators,” “all Applicators,” “all For-Hire Applicators,” etc.). Operators covered under EPA’s PGP that are not required to submit an NOI must still comply with the provisions of the permit applicable to them where those requirements are not identified as only applicable to Operators required to submit an NOI.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-60&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;Are separate NOIs required from Decision-makers for each pesticide application and/or for each separate treatment area?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-60&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;No. EPA’s Pesticide General Permit (PGP) provides flexibility for Decision-makers on how information can be provided in the Notice of Intent (NOI). However, EPA expects that in most instances the Decision-maker will submit one NOI to cover all its pesticide applications in all treatment areas. The NOI is structured to allow for this flexibility. The only exception is that an NOI cannot include information for more than one state. Thus if a Decision-maker is required to submit an NOI for permit coverage and that Decision-maker’s activities are performed in more than one state, an NOI must be submitted for each state where those activities are to be performed. “Pest management areas” are those areas where the Decision-maker may be managing pests, and such management results in a discharge to waters of the United States. For example, an NOI may identify multiple pest management areas at the different state parks throughout an entire state, a mosquito district, or a single lake. Decision-makers have flexibility to decide which pest management areas are included on a single NOI. For example, a Decision-maker may, if it so chooses, submit separate NOIs for each of its treatment areas. However, EPA expects most Decision-makers will prefer having all their activities identified on one NOI.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-61&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;If a Decision-maker requires permit coverage in multiple states covered by EPA’s PGP, can that Decision-maker file one NOI for all the states?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-61&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;No. EPA established the Notice of Intent (NOI) requirements to address states on an individual basis, corresponding with the applicable National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit number identified in Appendix C of EPA’s Pesticide General Permit (PGP). As such, an NOI cannot include information for more than one state. Decision-makers requiring permit coverage in more than one state covered by EPA’s PGP (e.g., Massachusetts and New Hampshire) must submit an NOI for each state for which permit coverage is required with that NOI containing information specific to pesticide application activities in that state.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-62&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;Is an NOI required if an Operator applies only larvicides (not adulticides) for mosquito control?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-62&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;It depends. Any mosquito control district (or similar pest control district) or agency (federal or state) for which pest management for land resource stewardship is an integral part of the organization’s operations is required to submit a Notice of Intent (NOI) for all of its pesticide applications (larvicides and adulticides) that result in discharges to waters of the United States. See Table 1-1 of EPA’s Pesticide General Permit (PGP). Conversely, except for discharges to Tier 3 waters (i.e., Outstanding National Resource Water) or National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Listed Resources of Concern, which always require an NOI, any local government or other type of Operator is not required to submit an NOI if it:&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;o uses only larvicides, or o uses both larvicides and adulticides but applies adulticides to less than 6,400 acres a year.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Regardless of whether an NOI is required, discharges from both adulticides and larvicides require coverage under EPA’s PGP and discharges from these activities must comply with the appropriate provisions of the PGP.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-63&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;Are all federal facilities (in areas where EPA’s PGP applies) required to submit an NOI for their pesticide application activities?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-63&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;EPA’s Pesticide General Permit (PGP) specifies that “any agency for which pest management for land resource stewardship is an integral part of the organization’s operations” is required to submit a Notice of Intent (NOI) for any discharges eligible for coverage under EPA’s PGP. EPA uses the term “agency” in the PGP to refer to federal and state agencies and believes that most pest control activities performed by federal and state agencies that result in discharges to waters of the United States will meet the requirement to submit an NOI.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;EPA recognizes, however, that many such public entities may perform ad-hoc pest control on a small-scale that is not related to land resource stewardship, but rather incidental, for example, to its occupancy of a building. As an example, the U.S. Social Security Administration may maintain a building or group of buildings where weeds have overtaken a parking lot that is adjacent to a lake, and the local office determines that it should control those weeds with an herbicide. EPA would not consider this type of weed control related to land resource stewardship, but rather as incidental to operation of the facility. By contrast, a federal or state transportation department controlling weeds in flowing waters adjacent to roads would be considered to be performing a function associated with its land resource management purposes and as such would be required to submit an NOI. Similarly, the application of adulticides on a military base by the Department of Defense would also be considered an activity associated with a land resource management responsibility to protect public health, although incidental weed management around buildings on the base generally would not be considered a stewardship responsibility. To be clear, in all instances described above, discharges would require permit coverage; however, the requirement to submit an NOI is based only on those land stewardship responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-64&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;In determining whether a Decision-maker exceeds an annual treatment area threshold (i.e., 80 acres or 20 linear miles or 6,400 acres) for the purpose of the Notice of Intent submission, is the Decision-maker required to aggregate all pesticide applications that result in a discharge to waters of the United States, regardless of the pesticide use patterns?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-64&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;No. EPA’s Pesticide General Permit (PGP) establishes annual treatment area thresholds for each of the four pesticide use patterns (i.e., mosquito and other flying insect pests, weeds and algae, animal pests, and forest canopy pests). Decision-makers must calculate the annual treatment area independently for each of the four pesticide use patterns - including only those pesticide activities that result in a discharge to waters of the United States. See the question below on how to calculate the annual treatment areas.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-65&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;How do Operators calculate the treatment area?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-65&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The “Treatment Area” as defined in Appendix A of EPA’s Pesticide General Permit (PGP) is the entire area, whether over land or water, where a pesticide application is intended to provide pesticidal benefits within the pest management area. In some instances, the treatment area will be larger than the area where pesticides are actually applied. For example, the treatment area for a stationary drip treatment into a canal includes the entire width and length of the canal over which the pesticide is intended to control weeds. Similarly, the treatment area for a lake or marine area is the water surface area where the application is intended to provide pesticidal benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The procedures for calculating the treatment area are identified in Appendix A of EPA’s PGP in the definition of the term “annual treatment area threshold.”&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;For calculating annual treatment areas for Weed and Algae Control and Animal Pest Control, calculations should include either the linear extent of, or the surface area of, waters for applications made to waters of the United States or at water’s edge, adjacent to waters of the United States. For calculating the annual treatment area, count each treatment area only once, regardless of the number of pesticide application activities performed on that area in a given year. Also, for any linear feature (e.g., a canal or ditch), use the length of the linear feature, whether treating in, or adjacent to, the feature, regardless of the number of applications made to that feature during the calendar year. For example, whether treating the bank on one side of a ten-mile long ditch, banks on both sides of the ditch, and/or water in that ditch, the total treatment area is ten miles. Additionally, if the same 10 mile area is treated more than once in a calendar year, the total area treated is still 10 miles. Also, the treatment area for these two pesticide use patterns (Weed and Algae Control and Animal Pest Control) is not additive over the calendar year. Each pesticide use pattern (Animal Pest Control, etc.) is to be evaluated separately and compared to the applicable threshold.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;For calculating annual treatment areas for Mosquitoes and Other Flying Insect Pest Control and Forest Canopy Pest Control, calculations should include all applications made by the Decision-maker, regardless of whether those individual applications may result in a discharge to waters of the United States. As long as some portion of the treatment results in a discharge requiring permit coverage, the calculation of treatment area for these two use patterns are to include all activities made by the Decision-maker during the calendar year. Also, unlike the previous two use patterns, the treatment area is additive over the calendar year (i.e., multiple treatments to the same area are to be combined to calculate a cumulative treatment area). Also, for purposes of calculating annual treatment areas for mosquito control, only adulticide applications are to be counted. While larvaciding that results in discharges to waters of the United States do require permit coverage, those activities are not to be included in the calculation of area treatment (for purpose of determining if a Notice of Intent is required). Similar to the previous two pesticide use patterns, each pesticide use pattern (Mosquitoes and Other Flying Insect Pest Control and Forest Canopy Pest Control) is to be evaluated separately and compared to the applicable threshold.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-66&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;In determining whether a Decision-maker exceeds an annual treatment area threshold for a specific pesticide use pattern (i.e., 80 acres or 20 linear miles or 6,400 acres) for the purpose of the Notice of Intent submission, is the Decision-maker required to aggregate all pesticide applications that result in a discharge to waters of the United States for that use pattern, regardless of the pest management areas?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-66&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Yes. “Pest management areas” are those areas where the Decision-maker may be managing pests within a state. Treatment areas are those areas within the pest management areas where pesticide activities actually will be performed, and that will result in a discharge to waters of the United States. For each pesticide use pattern, the total annual treatment area must include all treatment areas where pesticide activities are expected to be performed that will result in a discharge to waters of the United States, for all the pest management areas within a state.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-67&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;If a Decision-maker is required to submit an NOI solely due to the fact that their pesticide applications will exceed an annual treatment area threshold, when should the NOI be filed?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-67&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The Decision-maker must file the Notice of Intent (NOI) at least ten days before exceeding an annual treatment area threshold. Such deadlines are listed in Table 1-2 of EPA’s Pesticide General Permit.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-68&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;If only a portion of a Decision-maker’s pesticide applications result in discharges to waters of the United States, can the rest of the treatment area be excluded from the annual treatment area calculation? &lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-68&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;EPA’s Pesticide General Permit (PGP) establishes annual treatment area thresholds for each of the four pesticide use patterns (i.e., mosquito and other flying insect pests, weeds and algae, animal pests, and forest canopy pests). For two of the four pesticide use patterns - weeds and algae and animal pests - the annual treatment area is to be calculated based only on those applications that result in discharges to waters of the United States (i.e., treatment areas can be excluded that do not result in discharges to waters of the United States). However, for the other two pesticide use patterns - mosquito and other flying insect pests and forest canopy pests -the area treated is the entire area to be treated rather than only those areas that result in discharges to waters of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-69&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;Is permit coverage under EPA’s PGP automatic upon submission of a Notice of Intent?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-69&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;No. See Table 1-2 of EPA’s Pesticide General Permit (PG), NOI Submittal Deadlines and Discharge Authorization Dated for Discharges from the Application of Pesticides. Activities may be covered as early as ten days after EPA receives a complete and accurate Notice of Intent (NOI). However, it may take 30 days or longer in treatment areas with National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Listed Resources of Concern.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-70&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;Can a senior executive officer at a federal facility be the signatory for an NOI required by EPA’s PGP?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-70&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;It depends. Appendix B.11.A.3 of EPA’s Pesticide General Permit (PGP) states that the Notice of Intent (NOI) for a municipality, state, federal, or other public agency is to be signed by either a principal executive officer or ranking elected official. A principal executive officer of a federal agency includes (i) the chief executive officer of the agency, or (ii) a senior executive officer having responsibility for the overall operations of a principal geographic unit or the agency (e.g., Regional Administrator of EPA).&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A federal facility can be considered a principal geographic unit if the senior executive officer has responsibility for the overall operation of the federal facility. Otherwise, a senior executive officer of the regional office, or the agency that has responsibility for the overall operation of the federal facility, is the signatory for the NOI.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-71&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;Can a principal executive officer of a federal agency delegate NOI approval and signature responsibility?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-71&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;No. National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) regulations do not allow for delegation of responsibility for signing and certifying a Notice of Intent (NOI). Other types of NPDES documents, such as annual reports and Pesticide Discharge Management Plans, may be delegated and signed by a duly authorized representative of the principal executive officer, consistent with delegation procedures described in Section B.11.B of Appendix B of EPA’s Pesticide General Permit.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-72&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;Do Decision-makers need to submit an updated NOI when the signatory for their NOI (i.e., principal executive officer, ranking elected official, responsible corporate officer) moves to another position?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-72&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;No. There is no need to submit a new Notice of Intent (NOI) or update an existing NOI because the signatory of the NOI has changed. Any subsequent documents that need to be signed can be signed by the new signatory. If an updated NOI is required, the new signatory can contact EPA NOI processing center to gain access to the NOI submitted by a previous signatory.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-73&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;No, unless the discharge is to waters of the United States containing National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Listed Resources of Concern. See Part 1.2.3, Table 1-3 of EPA’s Pesticide General Permit.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;

		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-74&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;No. Any updated Applicator information is to be provided to EPA in the annual report, not in an updated Notice of Intent.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-75&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;For what reason should a Decision-maker modify an NOI?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-75&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;EPA’s Pesticide General Permit (PGP) requires Decision-makers to submit changes to previous NOI forms where, for example, coverage for an additional discharge not included in the original NOI is being requested. EPA expects these requests for NOI changes to be submitted primarily in four instances:&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;coverage for a new or expanded pest management area is being requested,&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;discharge to a Tier 3 water is identified for permit coverage,&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;discharge to any waters of the United States containing National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Listed Resources of Concern, as defined in Appendix A of the permit, is being requested, or&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;changes in the treatment area, pesticide product, method or rate of application, or approximate dates of applications for discharges to waters of the United States containing NMFS Listed Resources of Concern.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In these four instances, Decision-makers are required to submit revised NOIs that reflect changes in the areas and types of activities for which coverage is being requested. See Part 1.2.2 of the permit and Part III, 1.2.2 of the accompanying fact sheet.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-76&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;What are the requirements under EPA’s PGP?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-76&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;EPA’s Pesticide General Permit (PGP) delineates different responsibilities for different types of Operators as well as different types of pesticide application activities and locations of those activities. For example, the permit assigns different responsibilities to Decision-makers and Applicators; although any Operator covered under the permit is still responsible, jointly and severally, for any violation associated with its discharge. Similarly, the permit includes different requirements for discharges from the control of mosquitoes or from the control of pests in the forest canopy. EPA has developed a step-by-step, interactive, &lt;a href=&quot;/npdes/pesticide-permitting-permitting-decision-tool&quot;&gt;online tool&lt;/a&gt; on its pesticide website to help Operators summarized their requirements under the EPA’s PGP.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-77&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;How do Decision-makers determine if they are a large entity or small entity, for the purpose of EPA’s PGP?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-77&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Under EPA’s Pesticide General Permit (PGP), “small entity” is defined as any (1) private enterprise that does not exceed the Small Business Administration size standard as identified at 13 CFR 121.201, or (2) local government that serves a population of 10,000 or less. All other Operators are considered large entities for purposes of EPA’s PGP.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-78&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;Are all federal agencies considered large entities for the purpose of EPA’s Pesticide General Permit?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-78&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-79&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;How do quasi-governmental entities, such as irrigation districts, determine if they are large or small entities, for purposes of EPA’s Pesticide General Permit?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-79&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Small Business Administration statutory language implies that special districts fall into the government category. See SEC. 601. DEFINITIONS [CITE: 5 USC 601]. Thus, quasi-governmental entities should use the population of the area served, not the number of customer accounts, to determine if they are large or small entity.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-80&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;Does compliance with Whole Effluent Toxicity testing to demonstrate consistency with the &quot;free from toxics&quot; narrative standard apply under EPA’s PGP?&quot;&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-80&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;EPA’s Pesticide General Permit (PGP) does not require Operators to perform water quality testing (including no requirement to monitor whole effluent toxicity). As written, EPA assumes that pesticide applications performed consistent with the PGP will generally be adequate to protect water quality.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-81&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;How do aerial applicators comply with the &quot;visual monitoring&quot; requirement?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-81&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The monitoring requirements in EPA’s Pesticide General Permit (PGP) provides flexibility for Applicators to respond to the wide range of environments, situations, and targets to which pesticides may be applied. Visual monitoring is required only when safety and feasibility allow visual assessment of the treatment area. See Part 4.1 of EPA’s PGP. Visual monitoring during post-application surveillance is required of all Operators, but only if the Operator (i.e. Applicator, the Decision-maker or both) performs post-application surveillance in the normal course of business. The PGP does not require aerial applicators to perform post-application surveillance unless such surveillance is part of the Operator’s normal course of business.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-82&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;Are Decision-makers, who are required to submit an NOI solely because their application will result in discharges to waters of the United States containing NMFS Listed Resources of Concern, required to develop a Pesticide Discharge Management Plan (PDMP)?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-82&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;No. Any Decision-maker who is or will be required to submit a Notice of Intent (NOI) must prepare a Pesticide Discharge Management Plan (PDMP) with two exceptions:&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;o The application made in response to a Declared Pest Emergency Situation, or o The Decision-maker is required to submit an NOI solely because their application results in a point source discharge to waters of the United States containing U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Listed Resources of Concern.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-83&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;When are Decision-makers who are required to develop a Pesticide Discharge Management Plan (PDMP) required to develop that plan?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-83&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Decision-makers required to develop a Pesticide Discharge Management Plan (PDMP) must do so by the time the Notice of Intent (NOI) is filed.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-84&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;When do Decision-makers need to update their Pesticide Discharge Management Plan (PDMP)?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-84&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Decision-makers must modify their Pesticide Discharge Management Plan (PDMP) whenever necessary to address any of the triggering conditions for corrective action in Part 6.1 of EPA’s Pesticide General Permit, or when a change in pest control activities significantly changes the type or quantity of pollutants discharged. Changes to the PDMP must be made before the next pesticide application that results in a discharge, if practicable, or if not practicable, no later than 90 days after any change in pesticide application activities. The revised PDMP must be signed and dated in accordance with Appendix B, Subsection B.11 of PGP.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-85&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;Does EPA’s PGP require posting of the Pesticide Discharge Management Plan (PDMP) on the EPA’s website?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-85&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;In general, EPA&#039;s Pesticide General Permit (PGP) does not require posting of the PDMP on EPA’s website (nor does the PGP require the Decision-maker to submit the PDMP to EPA); however, as noted in Part 9 of the permit, some States, Tribes and territories do require the submission of PDMPs based on their Clean Water Act 401 certification of the permit.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;EPA’s PGP does require the Decision-maker to retain any required plan at the address provided in the NOI and make it readily available upon request to EPA, State, Tribal or local agencies governing discharges of pesticides in their respective jurisdictions and representatives of the U.S. Fish &amp;amp; Wildlife Service or the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-86&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;Does EPA’s PGP require submission of records indicating that visual monitoring for adverse effects has taken place?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-86&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;EPA’s Pesticide General Permit (PGP) does not require submission of visual monitoring records. However, all Decision-makers who are required to submit an NOI and all Operators who are For-Hire Applicators are required to retain records on whether or not visual monitoring was conducted during pesticide application and/or post-application. If visual monitoring was not conducted they must note the reason. In addition, they must also note whether monitoring identified any possible or observable adverse incidents caused by application of pesticides.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-87&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;Who must submit an annual report for pesticide application point source discharges?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-87&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Parts 7.6 and 7.7 of EPA’s Pesticide General Permit (PGP) require Decision-makers who meet the following conditions to submit an annual report:&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Any Decision-maker who is required to submit a Notice of Intent (NOI) and is a large entity (as defined in Appendix A of EPA’s PGP), or&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Any Decision-maker who is required to submit an NOI and is a small entity with discharges to waters of the United States containing U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Listed Resources of Concern as defined in Appendix A of the PGP.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-88&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;If a Decision-maker contracted a commercial applicator to perform pest control, and the Decision-maker is mostly hands off, who must file the annual report?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-88&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;If the Decision-maker meets the conditions to submit an annual report (see the above question), the Decision-maker is responsible for submitting the annual report. However, if a commercial applicator is the “duly authorized representative” of the Decision-maker, the commercial applicator can prepare, sign, and submit the annual report on behalf of the Decision-maker. A person is a “duly authorized representative” if he or she meets the criteria outlined in B.11.B of Appendix B of EPA’s Pesticide General Permit.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-89&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;Where must the annual report required under EPA’s PGP be submitted/filed?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-89&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Decision-makers must submit the annual report electronically through EPA’s notice processing system (eNOI), available at www.epa.gov/npdes/pesticide-permitting, unless the Decision-maker meets the waiver requirements for submitting a paper annual report. Decision-makers waived from the requirement to use eNOI for annual report submission must sign and send in a wet signature copy of the paper annual report form to EPA at the appropriate address identified in the instructions on the annual report form provided in Appendix G of EPA’s Pesticide General Permit (PGP).&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-90&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;Are Decision-makers exempt from the annual reporting requirements if their previous calendar year treatment area is below the “annual treatment area threshold” values listed in EPA’s Pesticide General Permit (i.e., 80 acres, 20 linear miles, 6,400 acres)?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-90&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;No. There are no threshold values in EPA’s Pesticide General Permit (PGP) to determine whether or not annual reporting is required. The “annual treatment area threshold” values listed in EPA’s PGP established whether or not Operators must submit a Notice of Intent (NOI) to obtain coverage under EPA’s PGP and comply with more comprehensive permit requirements. See the question above, “Who must submit an annual report for pesticide application point source discharges?”&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Once a Decision-maker meets the obligation to submit an annual report, the Decision-maker must submit an annual report each calendar year thereafter for the duration of coverage under EPA’s PGP, whether or not the Decision-maker has discharges from the application of pesticides in any subsequent calendar year. After terminating permit coverage, the Decision-maker no longer has to submit an annual report, except to report any discharges that occurred during the year that coverage was terminated. For example, a Decision-maker submitting a Notice of Termination in September 2018 is required to submit an annual report for discharges between January and September 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-91&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;If a Decision-maker is required to file an annual report because the Decision-maker is a small entity with discharges to waters of the United States containing National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Listed Resources of Concern, does the Decision-maker need to report pesticide activities that occurred in the Decision-maker’s other pest management areas?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-91&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;No. In this scenario, the Decision-maker is required to report only the pesticide activities that result in discharges to waters of the United States containing NMFS Listed Resources of Concern.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-92&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;Since filing a Notice of Intent (NOI), the preparer and/or certifying official on that NOI no longer holds that position within the organization (or have left the organization altogether). How does a new preparer, new certifying official, or duly authorized representative of the Decision-maker file the annual report electronically?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-92&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The new preparer and/or new certifying official needs to register a new account in &lt;a href=&quot;https://cdx.epa.gov&quot;&gt;EPA&#039;s Central Data Exchange&lt;/a&gt;. Once registered, they must contact the &lt;a href=&quot;/npdes/contact-us-pesticide-permitting#NOI&quot;&gt;eNOI processing center&lt;/a&gt; to have the old information linked to the new account.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-93&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;What is a “pest management area” and a “treatment area,” as identified on the annual report form?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-93&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;A “pest management area” or “PMA” is an area where the Decision-maker may be managing pests within a state, and such management could result in a discharge to waters of the United States. A PMA is identified by the Decision-maker and reported to EPA when they file a Notice of Intent (NOI). A Decision-maker must use the PMAs identified on their NOI when completing the annual reports.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A “treatment area” is the entire area, whether over land or water, where an actual pesticide application is intended to provide pesticidal benefits within a pest management area. EPA’s Pesticide General Permit provides flexibility for Decision-makers to report treatment areas within a PMA as separate treatment areas or combine as one larger treatment area within a PMA. For example, non-contiguous areas treated once or several times or spot treatments may be reported as one treatment area provided the areas are within the same PMA.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-94&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;Can Decision-makers report the location of their treatment areas by attaching a map onto the annual report instead of a written description?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-94&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Yes, as described in Part 7.6 of EPA’s Pesticide General Permit, for each treatment area the annual report must include: a description or map of each treatment area indicating at a minimum, the location and size, (acres or linear feet) of treatment area, and identification of any waters, either by name or by location, to which pesticide(s) are discharged.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-95&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;For the annual report, how does a Decision-maker calculate the size of treatment areas?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-95&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;When reporting the “size of treatment area” on the annual report, count each treatment area only once, regardless of the pesticide use patterns and the number of pesticide application activities performed on that same area in a given year. The treatment area is not additive over the calendar year. However, note that for the purposes of reporting the amount of pesticides used, Decision-makers must report the total amount of pesticides used over the calendar year. For example, if 10 pounds of a pesticide is applied one day to a defined treatment area and then 20 pounds the next month to that same treatment area, the annual report should identify 30 pounds as the amount applied in the calendar year for that treatment area.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-96&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;Are Decision-makers required to report pesticide applications to terrestrial areas in their annual reports?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-96&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;It depends. Decision-makers are required to report pesticide activities that result in discharges of pesticides to waters of the United States regardless of whether the waters of the United States are wet, partially wet, or dry at the time of the discharge. If the terrestrial area is a water of the United States, the Decision-maker is required to report the pesticide activities.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-97&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;Are Decision-makers required to include in their annual reports the adjuvants and surfactants used?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-97&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;No. Adjuvant and surfactants do not need to be reported in the annual report. Only the amount of the registered pesticide product, the quantity before water or any other substances are added, must be reported. The “pesticide product” is defined in Appendix A of EPA’s Pesticide General Permit, as the pesticide in the particular form (including composition, packaging, and labeling) in which the pesticide is, or is intended to be, distributed or sold.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-98&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;For the annual report, are Decision-makers required to identify which Applicator applied which products?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-98&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Not necessarily. EPA’s Pesticide General Permit (PGP) requires Decision-makers who submitted Notices of Intent to submit annual reports that identify the total amount of each pesticide product applied to each treatment area and a list of Applicators who performed the activities in each treatment area. The PGP does not require the Decision-maker to link each specific application with the specific Applicator who performed that activity.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-99&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;An annual report was filed in error, how do Decision-makers delete or correct their annual reports?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-99&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The annual reporting system was designed such that once the Annual Report is certified, no edits can be made to that Annual Report. However, Decision-makers can submit another report to supersede their original report.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-100&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;Who must submit a Notice of Termination (NOT)?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-100&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Any Decision-maker who was required to submit an NOI and meets the conditions of Part 1.2.5 of EPA’s Pesticide General Permit (PGP) is required to submit an NOT to terminate coverage under the permit. NOTs can be filed through the eNOI system. If the Decision-maker is required to submit annual reports prior to the termination of coverage under the PGP, an annual report must be submitted for the portion of the year up through the date of termination.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-101&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;If there is a pest-related public health emergency (e.g., West Nile Virus from mosquitoes), are Operators waived from obtaining an NPDES permit for pesticide application activities that result in discharges to waters of the United States?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-101&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;No. The Clean Water Act and the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) regulations do not provide a waiver from NPDES permits for emergency situations, even those related to public health. Although permit coverage is required, EPA’s Pesticide General Permit allows Operators to be covered for declared pest emergency situations, without delay, by:&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;delaying the submission of the Notice of Intent (NOI) for those Decision-makers otherwise required to submit an NOI (see Table 1-2 and Table 1-3 of the Pesticide General Permit), and&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;not requiring development of a Pesticide Discharge Management Plan (PDMP) for such a pesticide application.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;pest&quot; name=&quot;pest&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Declared Pest Emergency&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;accordion&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-102&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;Are pesticide activities that are conducted as part of a public declaration of a pest emergency but begin ten days or more after the identification of the need for pest control considered “Declared Pest Emergency Situation” under EPA’s PGP?&lt;/a&gt;

		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-102&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;No. EPA’s Pesticide General Permit (PGP) defines a “Declared Pest Emergency Situation” as an event defined by a public declaration by a federal agency, state, or local government of a pest problem determined to require control through application of a pesticide beginning less than ten days after identification of the need for pest control. See Appendix A of EPA’s PGP. The goal of the “Declared Pest Emergency Situation” provision is to allow Decision-makers to respond to pest emergencies without delay.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-103&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;Is a Declared Pest Emergency Situation, as defined in EPA’s PGP, limited to only pesticide activities conducted within ten days of that declaration?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-103&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;No, although for an event to be considered a Declared Pest Emergency Situation under EPA’s Pesticide General Permit (PGP), the first pesticide application must be conducted less than ten days after the public declaration. Any subsequent pesticide activities that are necessary and described in the declaration are also considered to be part of the emergency.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-104&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;When are Decision-makers required to submit an NOI for pesticide applications made in response to a Declared Pest Emergency Situation?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-104&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Decision-makers are required to submit a Notice of Intent (NOI) within 30 days of commencing a pesticide application that results in a discharge to waters of the United States unless those waters contain U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Listed Resources of Concern, in which case the NOI must be submitted within 15 days of commencing discharge. See Table 1-2 of EPA’s Pesticide General Permit.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;EPA expects that in many instances, the Decision-maker responding to a Declared Pest Emergency Situation will already have an active NOI for the routine pest control activities in the same pest management area. In those instances, the Decision-maker is not required to submit a new NOI for the emergency, provided the contents of the active NOI includes activities included in the emergency declaration.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-105&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;After a declared pest emergency, is the Decision-maker required to submit another NOI for routine pesticide applications in the same area?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-105&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;No. Another Notice of Intent (NOI) is not required but the Decision-maker is required to update the NOI if the criteria in Part 1.2.3, Table 1-3 of EPA’s Pesticide General Permit are met.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-106&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;Are Decision-makers required to develop a PDMP for pesticide activities associated with a Declared Pest Emergency Situation?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-106&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;No. However, if there will be pesticide activities in the same area after the emergency event, a Pesticide Discharge Management Plan (PDMP) must be developed for those pesticide activities.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-107&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand description&quot;&gt;Are Decision-makers required to submit an annual report for activities associated with a Declared Pest Emergency Situation?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-107&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Yes. For activities covered under EPA’s Pesticide General Permit, an annual report is due by February 15th of the following calendar year.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
