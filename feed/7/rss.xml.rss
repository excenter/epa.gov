    <title>National Environmental Education Advisory Council 2015 Report to the Administrator</title>
    <link>https://www.epa.gov/education/national-environmental-education-advisory-council-2015-report-administrator-0</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;As one of the primary duties under its charter, the NEEAC is tasked with providing independent recommendations to the EPA Administrator to inform the Agency&#039;s strategic vision and enhance activities on environmental education. In October 2015, the most recent report of the National Environmental Education Advisory Council was sent to the EPA Adminstrator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Overview of the 2015 Report&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this report, the NEEAC reviews the current challenges and opportunities across the environmental education field and provides a resource for both EPA and the broader environmental community to further the effectiveness and availability of environmental education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recommendations from the NEEAC focus on three key action areas for EPA: engagement, leadership and funding. These areas are supported by the work of the Office of Environmental Education to champion, to collaborate and to communicate about EE within the Agency and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;General Overview: The EPA Environmental Education (EE) Grant Program&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;accordion&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-1&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;How does the 2016 EE Grant Program compare to the last competition?&lt;/a&gt;

		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-1&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Last year’s (FY 2014) EE Grant Program included two separate RFPs (also known as Solicitation Notices)– one for model, replicable projects, which were awarded grants from the Headquarters Office of Environmental Education (OEE), and another RFP for more localized projects, which were awarded grants from the 10 EPA regional offices. This year there will be no EE Model Grant RFP. There is only the EE Local Grant RFP, which is for locally-focused EE projects and requires sub-grants of $5,000 or less.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-3&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;How many grants does EPA expect to award in FY 2016?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-3&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Overall, EPA anticipates providing approximately $2.7 million through the FY 2016 RFP nationwide. The award amount for each grant will be approximately, but no more than, $91,000 in federal funds.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-4&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;What will be the level of funding for grants in this year&#039;s RFP?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-4&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Total funding available for EE grant projects under the FY 2016 RFP is anticipated to be approximately $2.7 million nationwide. The award amount for each individual grant will be approximately, but no more than, $91,000 in federal funds.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-5&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;How competitive is this grant program?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-5&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;This grant program generates a great deal of public enthusiasm for developing environmental education projects. Consequently, the competition is very intense and EPA receives many more applications for these grants than can be supported with available funds. In some past years the ratio of grant awards to applications have been anywhere from 1/10 to 1/30.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-6&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;Can I talk to someone in EPA’s EE Grant Program about my idea for a grant?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-6&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;No. EPA staff are not permitted to discuss potential grant ideas with potential applicants. The point of contact for the EE Grants Program may answer only technical questions that are not addressed in the RFP or in the FAQs.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-7&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;Whom can I contact if I need help with my proposal?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-7&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Applicants may send any questions regarding the submittal of their proposal to EEgrants@epa.gov. Applicants can keep checking the list of FAQs as it is updated during the open period of the solicitation.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The main EE Grants webpage will also provide announcements of dates, times and call-in numbers for conference call(s) that will be held by EPA&#039;s Office of Environmental Education to clarify points in the RFP. Applicants who need clarification about specific requirements in the RFP may contact Karen Scott in the Office of Environmental Education at EPA Headquarters in Washington, D.C. at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:eegrants@epa.gov&quot;&gt;eegrants@epa.gov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-8&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;How can I find out about upcoming RFPs/solicitation notices?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-8&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;If you wish to be notified about upcoming RFPs (also known as Solicitation Notices), visit the main &lt;a href=&quot;/education/environmental-education-ee-grants&quot;&gt;EE Grants webpage&lt;/a&gt; where you can sign up to receive e-newsletters from EPA&#039;s Office of Environmental Education. The e-newsletters will contain news and announcements related to notifications of new solicitation notices and other information on EPA&#039;s EE Grants Program.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-9&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;Can I see examples of previously funded projects in each Region, and by Headquarters?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-9&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Yes. Visit the main &lt;a href=&quot;/education/environmental-education-ee-grants&quot;&gt;EE Grants webpage&lt;/a&gt; and look under the tab called “Grants Awarded” to see the list and short descriptions of applications previously funded by this program.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-10&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;Are there other EE grant programs that I can apply to? &lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-10&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Yes. Other available grant funding opportunities are listed on the federal site &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grants.gov/web/grants/home.html&quot;&gt;www.grants.gov&lt;/a&gt; or on the grants page of the website for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neefusa.org/grants&quot;&gt;National Environmental Education Foundation.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;pagetop&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#main-content&quot;&gt;Top of Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;elig&quot; id=&quot;elig&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Eligibility&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul class=&quot;accordion&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-11&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;Who is eligible to apply for an EE Grant? &lt;/a&gt;

		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-11&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Any local education agency, college or university, state education or environmental agency, nonprofit organization as described in Section 501(C )(3) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, or a noncommercial educational broadcasting entity as defined and licensed by U.S. Federal Communications Commission may submit an application. A teacher&#039;s school district, an educator&#039;s nonprofit organization, or a faculty member&#039;s college or university may apply, but an individual teacher, educator, faculty member, student or citizen may not apply. Organizations located outside the United States or its territories are not eligible to apply. Tribal education agencies eligible to apply include schools or community colleges controlled by an Indian tribe, band or nation which is recognized as eligible for special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians, and which is not administered by the Bureau of Indian Education. For more specific information see Section III of the RFP.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-12&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;Can a student apply for a grant to study environmental education?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-12&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;No. Neither an individual student nor any individual person can apply for a grant from this program.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-13&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;Can a teacher apply for a grant to do an environmental education project with their students? &lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-13&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;No. Neither an individual teacher nor any individual person may apply for a grant from this program.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-14&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;Can an organization located in Canada or Mexico apply for a grant to do an environmental education project in the United States.? &lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-14&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;No. An organization must be located in the United States or one of its territories to be eligible to apply for a grant from this program.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-15&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;Is an application eligible if the work of the project is proposed to take place outside of the United States? &lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-15&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Possibly, if the applicant organization is located in the United States or one of its territories, AND, the majority of educational activities in the program take place in the United States; or in the United States. and Canada or Mexico; or in U.S. Territories.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-16&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;Is a 501 (c) (6) organization eligible to apply for an Environmental Education grant?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-16&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;No. A non-profit organization must be designated as a 501 (c) (3) by the Internal Revenue Service to apply for an Environmental Education Grant.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-17&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;Is a local government agency eligible to apply for a grant?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-17&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Yes. The RFP states that &quot;any local education agency...may submit a proposal.&quot; The Environmental Education Act does not define a &quot;local education agency.&quot; The term is defined in section 9101 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. If there is any question as to whether you are a local education agency, you can check with the state department of education in the state in which you are located.&lt;br /&gt;
				For purposes of applying for a grant through this RFP, make sure it is clear in your application that you have the authority to conduct education programs. You can demonstrate this authority by providing documentation from your state department of education, referencing the law or bylaws that establish your agency, quoting your current official mission statement, and/or showing us proof that your authority has been set by practice of education programs in the past. Be sure to include this information in a succinct statement in the Project Summary and in the Detailed Project Description, as well as in detail in the Programmatic Capability and Past Performance section of the application.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-18&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;Are county governments eligible?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-18&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Yes. Education or environment agencies within county governments are considered eligible as defined in the eligibility requirements (see Section III of the RFP).&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-19&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;My tribe is interested in applying for an EE grant. We would apply as a Federally Recognized Tribe and our Environmental Department, which does educate the community, would be the administrator of the grant. I did not see the term “federally recognized tribe” under the eligibility section, but I did see tribal organizations could be eligible. Are we eligible to receive a grant?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-19&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;No. Per the RFP: “Tribal education agencies” that are eligible to apply include a school or community college which is controlled by an Indian tribe, band, or nation, which is recognized as eligible for special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians and which is not administered by the Bureau of Indian Education. Tribal organizations do not qualify unless they meet that criteria or the non-profit criteria listed in Section III of the RFP. The terms for eligibility are defined in Section 3 of the National Environmental Education Act and 40 CFR 47.105. As stated, you do not match the description of a tribal education agency and would therefore not be eligible to apply for a grant.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-20&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;We are a Bureau of Indian Education contract school. We have a local tribal charter and are governed by a local school board. Are we eligible for an EE grant?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-20&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;No. Per Section III of the RFP: “Tribal education agencies that are eligible to apply include a school or community college which is controlled by an Indian tribe, band, or nation, which is recognized as eligible for special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians and which is not administered by the Bureau of Indian Education. Tribal organizations do not qualify unless they meet that criteria or the non-profit criteria listed above. The terms for eligibility are defined in Section 3 of the National Environmental Education Act and 40 CFR 47.105.”&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-21&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;Regarding eligibility, for the EE grants program, one eligible type of agency is a “tribal education agency.” Does this mean a school of some kind, or could a federally recognized tribe’s Environmental Health Department be considered a “tribal education agency?”&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-21&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;No. An entity like a tribal health department is not considered an eligible agency. Only schools or a community college which is controlled by an Indian tribe, band, or nation, including any Alaskan native village, which is recognized as eligible for special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians, and which is not administered by the Bureau of Indian Education, is eligible.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-22&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;May an organization apply for 501(c)(3) status at the same time as they apply for a grant, or do they have to have the status approved before they submit their application to the EPA?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-22&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Yes. An organization may apply for 501(C)(3) status at the same time that they apply for a grant, but the organization must have its 501(C)(3) status ALREADY APPROVED by the IRS to be eligible for an award under this grant program. If an applicant becomes a finalist for a grant but does not have its 501(C)(3) status approved by the time of the award, it will not be eligible for the award.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-23&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;We are part of a collaboration of 501(C)(3) non-profit environmental education centers. We run a residential EE program for school children. Can the EE grant funds be used to support residential EE programs conducted for elementary and middle school students?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-23&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Yes. As described, this sort of residential program would be eligible. If you intend to conduct your project as a collaboration of partners and want to apply for a grant under one of our RFPs, decide which one of you will be the applicant and “prime recipient”. Then be sure to get partnership letters of commitment from the other “centers”.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-24&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;We are a 501(c)(3) non-profit that receives funds through grants and corporate contributions and then redistributes 100% of those funds for EE programs at school districts in our region of the country. Are we eligible for an EE grant?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-24&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Yes. If you are an eligible entity as defined in the RFP (501c3 non-profits are eligible) and your proposed project is going to redistribute grant funds to eligible entities through sub-grants, your organization is eligible for an EE grant. You must, of course, adhere to the requirement that EXACTLY (no more and no less than) 25% of the funds you receive from EPA under an EE grant be awarded to sub-grantees in amounts of $5000 or less.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-25&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;What do you mean by eligible sub-grantees? &lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-25&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Sub-grantees are organizations that receive a part of the grant funds awarded by EPA to a &quot;Prime recipient&quot; (prime) through a process determined by the Prime. The Prime selects the sub-grantees, grants them the funds, and does all the follow up with them (i.e., EPA does not get involved in the sub-grant process). However, sub-grantee organizations must be eligible to receive funds per the same rules of eligibility as specified in the RFP for the Prime recipients (see Section III of the RFP).&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-26&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;We are an educational 501(c)(3) and a religious-based school. Are we eligible to apply for a grant from your program, even though we are an educational institution founded on religious principles?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-26&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Yes. As a 501(c)(3) organization, you are eligible to apply for an EE grant. The religious aspect is irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-27&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;My organization has never received an EE grant from EPA for a project that we’ve been running for several years. Would our project be eligible for funding from EPA?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-27&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Yes. Your project would be considered eligible for a grant through the EE program assuming that your organization meets all of the eligibility requirements as defined in the RFP. The fact that the project already exists under non-EPA funding does not prevent it from being eligible for funding under the current EPA EE Program RFP.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-28&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;What does the term “threshold eligibility criteria” mean, as used in the RFP?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-28&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Threshold eligibility criteria are requirements that an applicant must meet in order for their application to be deemed eligible for consideration for a grant award – in this case for a grant award from the Environmental Education Grant Program. (See Section III of the RFP for the list of threshold eligibility criteria.)&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-29&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;Must I meet all the threshold eligibility criteria to be considered eligible for a grant?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-29&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Yes. Failure to meet ALL the threshold eligibility criteria will result in disqualification of the application for funding consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-30&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;Are there any activities that are ineligible for funding in this program?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-30&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Yes. EE Grant funds cannot be used for the following activities:&lt;/p&gt;

			

			&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Technical training of environmental management professionals&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Environmental &quot;information&quot; and/or &quot;outreach&quot; projects that have no additional educational component, as described in Section I (B)&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Advocacy promoting a particular point of view or course of action&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Lobbying or political activities&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Non-educational research and development&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Construction projects- EPA will not fund construction activities such as the acquisition of real property (e.g. buildings) or the construction or modification of any building.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-31&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;If my project includes ineligible activities, will my entire project be ineligible for funding?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-31&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;If an application is submitted that includes any ineligible tasks or activities, that portion of the application will be ineligible for funding and may render the entire application ineligible for funding.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-32&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;What does EPA consider to be &quot;technical training for environmental management professionals&quot; and why isn&#039;t this considered to be environmental education?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-32&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;According to the National Environmental Education Act, “Environmental Education does not include technical training activities directed toward environmental management professionals or activities primarily directed toward the support of non-educational research and development.&quot; Technical training of environmental professionals generally refers to such activities and programs as certification of technical trades like waste water management, or practical workshops to update skills in areas like air quality monitoring, or on-the-job training of technicians such as green landscapers.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-33&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;Are construction activities eligible for funding?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-33&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;No. EE grants are non-construction grants, therefore construction activities will not be funded under the program. Examples of construction activities are: acquisition of real property (e.g., buildings or land), construction or modification of any building, such as constructing roof-top gardens, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-34&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;What kind of restrictions does your grant program put on construction programs? Would the installation of a rain garden qualify? Or a playground that was built to instruct children how a certain environmental principle works?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-34&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The RFP specifically prohibits using EPA funds for construction. The creation of something like a rain garden or a playground should be peripheral to an education project, not its main activity and not the major expense of the budget. The RFP doesn&#039;t allow the funds to be used, for example, for the construction of a building, even to hold environmental education classes or house environmental displays, etc. So if expenses to install a rain garden or playground dominate the budget and the project period, and require something like heavy equipment purchase or rental, then most likely the project is more construction than education and therefore ineligible. (Note: The RFP gives an example of a nature trail or a bird house as allowable expenses, but even these must be part of a larger education project, not the primary focus of the project and/or expenditure of the budget.)&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-35&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;Would installing solar panels be considered a construction project if the purpose of installing them is to demonstrate a way to deal with environmental issues?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-35&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Yes. Installing solar panels is clearly a construction project and therefore is not an eligible activity for receiving funds through the EE Grant Program.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-36&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;Who reviews my application for eligibility?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-36&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Applications to the EE Local Grants RFP will be reviewed for threshold eligibility by an EE Coordinator or designee in the EPA Region in which the proposed project will be located.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-37&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;If my application is deemed ineligible, when will I be notified?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-37&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Ineligible applicants will be notified within 15 calendar days of the determination that they are ineligible based on the threshold eligibility criteria.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;In order to be eligible, all applicants must address &lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;at least one&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt; of the following &lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;environmental&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt; priorities (see Section III of the RFP for more information):&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Addressing Climate Change and Improving Air Quality&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Taking Action on Toxics and Chemical Safety&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Making a Visible Difference in Communities Across the Country&lt;/li&gt;

		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-40&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;No. The project must only address &lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;at least one&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt; of the educational priorities, and &lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;at least one&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt; of the environmental priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-41&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Yes. Applications may address more than one priority in each category. However, it is important that the application is clear as to what the focus of the project will be and how that focus will contribute to a project with quality outputs and outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-42&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;Will I get a higher score in the proposal review if I address more than one educational or environmental priority?&lt;/a&gt;

	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-43&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;Does EPA give any of the educational or environmental priorities a higher degree of importance or priority than any of the others?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-43&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;No. None of the educational or environmental priorities listed in the RFP are considered of higher importance or priority to EPA than any of the others.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-44&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;What are EPA’s Strategic Goals? &lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-44&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The following are EPA’s Strategic Goals as outlined in &lt;a href=&quot;/planandbudget/strategicplan&quot;&gt;EPA&#039;s FY 2014-2018 Strategic Plan&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
				Goal 1. Taking Action of Climate Change and Improving Air Quality&lt;br /&gt;
				Goal 2: Protecting America’s Waters&lt;br /&gt;
				Goal 3: Cleaning Up Communities and Advancing Sustainable Development&lt;br /&gt;
				Goal 4: Ensuring the Safety of Chemicals and Preventing Pollution&lt;br /&gt;
				Goal 5: Enforcing Environmental Laws&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-45&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;Does my proposal have to specifically describe how it will support one or more Strategic Goals of the EPA? If so, where do I find more information on these goals? &lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-45&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Yes. Applications must specifically reference one or more of EPA&#039;s Strategic Goals in the proposal and explain how the project will support the goal(s). Read more about EPA’s Strategic Goals in &lt;a href=&quot;/planandbudget/strategicplan&quot;&gt;EPA&#039;s FY 2014-2018 Strategic Plan.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-46&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;Must a project address climate change AND air quality or clean up communities AND advance sustainable development or ensure chemical safety AND prevent pollution, as stated in the Strategic Goals 1, 3 and 4? Or can our project address one or the other of each of these actions in whichever Goal we focus on?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-46&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The project can address either one (e.g., climate change OR air quality) or both environmental issues (e.g., climate change AND air quality) as listed in each of those Strategic Goals.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-47&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;Would an environmental focus such as indoor air quality be appropriate under the category of community projects and community-focused stewardship activities?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-47&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Yes. Both indoor and outdoor environmental issues would be appropriate as community projects.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-48&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;Do community-focused stewardship activities need to focus on just teachers and/or students or could they include other community members?&lt;/a&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Community members of any age could qualify as audience members in a project funded by this grant program—not just teachers and/or students.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-49&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;Can we apply for funding for an outreach project that focuses on global environmental issues? &lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-49&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Yes. However, the applicant must be located in the United States or its territories and the majority of the project&#039;s activities must take place in the United States, or in the United States and Canada or Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-50&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;Does this program fund the development of environmental education materials or curriculum?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-50&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;EPA encourages applicants to use existing quality environmental education materials when available, rather than developing new ones, because many existing quality materials are under-utilized.&lt;br /&gt;
				EPA will consider funding the development of new materials where the applicant demonstrates that there is a need (e.g., that existing quality educational materials cannot be adapted to a particular local environmental concern or audience or existing quality materials are not available). You should specify what steps you have taken to determine this need (e.g., you may cite a conference where this need was discussed, the results of inquiries made within your community or with educational institutions, or a research paper or other published document).&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-51&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;How do I evaluate and select high quality environmental education materials among the many existing choices that seem relevant to my project?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-51&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;When determining what educational materials to use in your project, EPA recommends you review “Environmental Education Materials: Guidelines for Excellence”, which can be downloaded or ordered by going to &lt;a href=&quot;/education/environmental-education-ee-publications&quot;&gt;EPA’s environmental education publications webpage.&lt;/a&gt; This publication provides guidance on developing, evaluating, and selecting quality environmental education materials. If you don&#039;t know yet which materials you will use as part of your project, you should identify in your proposal what steps you will take to search for and select those materials.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-52&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;Where can I find a resource on environmental educators, if I want my project to focus on environmental education teaching skills?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-52&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;A resource to help guide projects that address environmental education teaching skills is the &#039;Guidelines for the Preparation and Professional Development of Environmental Educators&#039; developed with EPA funds. You may download or order a copy of this publication by going to &lt;a href=&quot;/education/environmental-education-ee-publications&quot;&gt;EPA’s environmental education publications webpage.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-53&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;Can an EE grant be used for a program that targets primarily adults, with little or no K-12 component, such as a program to educate homeowners associations, civic groups and elected officials on local environmental issues?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-53&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Yes. EE grants can be used to provide environmental education to adults.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-54&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;Are applicants required to serve K-12 students as part of their target audience?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-54&quot;&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-55&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;How does EPA define “students”—e.g., are university students considered an eligible target audience?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-55&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Yes. University students are considered “students” under the eligibility criteria for projects in the EE Grants Program. “Students” in EE projects funded by EPA may be any age and the term may be used to refer to students of informal education programs as well -- for example, programs held in nature centers, zoos, or science centers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;accordion&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-56&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;How does the EE Grants Program define &lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;Environmental Education&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/a&gt;

		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-56&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;EPA’s EE Grants Program defines environmental education (EE) as activities that increase public awareness and knowledge about environmental issues and provide participants with the skills necessary to make informed decisions and to take responsible actions. EE is based on objective and scientifically-sound information and does not advocate a particular viewpoint or a particular course of action. EE teaches individuals how to weigh various sides of an issue through critical thinking, problem solving and decision making skills on environmental topics. EE covers the range of steps and activities from awareness to action with an ultimate goal of environmental stewardship. EE involves lifelong learning; its audiences are of all age groups, from very young children through senior citizens. EE can include both outdoor and in-classroom education, in both formal and informal settings.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-57&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;How does the EE Grant Program define &lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;Environmental Information&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-57&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Environmental information provides facts or opinions about environmental issues or problems. Information is essential to any educational effort. However, environmental information is not, by itself, environmental education. Information provides facts or opinions whereas education teaches people how to think, analyze, and solve problems.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-58&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;How does the EE Grant program define &lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;Environmental Outreach&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-58&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Environmental outreach disseminates information and sometimes asks audiences to take specific action, but doesn’t necessarily teach people how to analyze an issue. Outreach often presents a particular point of view, and often in pursuit of a particular goal. Examples may include a community meeting to inform residents about a toxic site in their area and where they can go for help, or a campaign to get volunteer participants for a beach or stream cleanup event.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-59&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;Why are environmental information and outreach not classified as EE?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-59&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Environmental education may include environmental information and outreach, but environmental education fosters critical thinking, problem solving and decision making skills on environmental topics. Environmental education covers the range of steps and activities from awareness to action with an ultimate goal of environmental stewardship. Environmental information simply provides facts and outreach provides direct contact, personalized messaging and activities about a specific topic. Information and outreach are valuable tools, but are used for different purposes than education.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-60&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;Can my project focus on environmental information and outreach? &lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-60&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;No. Environmental education may include environmental information and outreach, but these activities alone, or as the main focus of the project, do not qualify as environmental education, and therefore do not qualify for this EPA grant. The applicant must demonstrate how their project will reflect the components of environmental education as defined in the RFP.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-61&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;What is the difference between outputs and outcomes of a project?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-61&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Outputs are tangible products developed during the life of the grant, such as lesson plans, workshops, websites, field trips, stewardship activities, etc. Outcomes are non-tangible results achieved by implementing the outputs, such as a better understanding of an environmental topic, or an attitude change, or a commitment to long term stewardship.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-62&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;What is the difference between a short-term output and a short-term outcome?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-62&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;A short-term output is an activity, effort or work product, such as training sessions for formal and informal educators or development of educational materials and websites that can be measured qualitatively or quantitatively during the funded period. A short-term outcome is a result, effect or consequence that will occur from carrying out the outputs of the environmental education project during the project period such as increased knowledge, skills and motivation.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The roles of the prime, partners, contractors and sub-grantees.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;accordion&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-63&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;What is a &quot;prime&quot; recipient? &lt;/a&gt;

		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-63&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The prime recipient is the organization that applies for and receives a grant directly from EPA. The prime recipient is responsible for determining the goals and of the project and how they will be accomplished, deciding how the sub-grantees will be selected, including the assurance that all sub-grantees are deemed eligible according to the RFP, and ensuring that the project meets its goals within the timeframe and budget proposed.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-64&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;What is a &quot;partner&quot;?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-64&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;A partner is an organization (or for-profit company) that makes a commitment to join the applicant (the prime) in the design and/or implementation of the proposed project by providing funds and/or services integral to the accomplishment of the project’s goals. Usually a partnering organization (or company) has similar organizational goals to the prime/applicant and/or experience/expertise needed in the project. Applicants may work with one or more partners to develop, design and implement proposed projects. If an entity designated in the proposal as a partner is not involved in the development, design or implementation of the project and/or does not provide a letter of commitment, then it is not a true partner according to the EPA EE Grant Program.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-65&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;What is the difference between a &quot;partner&quot; and a &quot;sub-grantee&quot;?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-65&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The EE Grants Program considers a partner to be an organization that makes a commitment to join the applicant (the prime) in the design and/or implementation of the proposed project by providing funds and/or services integral to the accomplishment of the project’s goals. The prime may partner with an organization to help achieve the required minimum 25% (of the total budget) match; i.e., the partner is providing cash or donating time and services. The prime may also partner with an organization for their experience or expertise. Partners and primes have mutual interests and are both committed to the success of the project, but the prime recipient is responsible for accomplishing the goals of the project within the timeframe and budget proposed in the original grant proposal. A partner cannot receive a sub-grant unless the partner is an eligible entity as defined in Section III of the RFP.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Sub-grantees receive an award from the prime recipient to perform tasks integral to the project’s goals, as outlined by the prime. Sub-grantees are selected by the prime and must be eligible entities as outlined in the RFP (Section III). They are often the local level community-based organizations with audiences proposed to be reached by a project. For example, some organizations have chapters around the country. Sub-grants to these chapters help implement the project and reach targeted audiences. Another example would be for the prime recipient to award sub-grants to school districts to carry out activities proposed in the work plan.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-66&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;What is the difference between a “sub-grantee” and a “contractor”?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-66&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;A sub-grantee is an eligible organization (as defined by the RFP) that receives an award from the prime recipient to perform tasks integral to the project’s goals, as outlined by the prime. The sub-grantees are often local level community-based organizations with audiences proposed to be reached by a project. For example, some organizations have chapters around the country. Sub-grants to these chapters help implement the project and reach targeted audiences. Another example would be for the prime recipient to award sub-grants to school districts to carry out activities proposed in the work plan.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A contractor is an individual, organization, or for-profit company that receives money from a prime recipient, sub-grantee, or partner to provide goods or services (work tasks) considered non-integral or non-substantive to the project’s goals. The person or organization performing the evaluation of the project is often a contractor, as is a company providing buses for field trips or setting up computer labs at a research site, for examples. All contracts must be competed.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-66.5&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;Do you have a graphic that summarizes the roles and responsibilities of a prime recipient, a partner, a sub-grantee and a contractor? &lt;/a&gt;

						&lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;

						&lt;td&gt;x&lt;/td&gt;
						&lt;td&gt;x&lt;/td&gt;

	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-67&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;If we partner with an external professional evaluator would that be considered a contract or sub-grant and count towards the 25% sub-grant requirement? &lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-67&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Generally, an external evaluator needs to have some objectivity, and therefore would not be in a position to be a partner in the project they are evaluating. Usually an external evaluator is hired for their services, and this would be considered a contractual arrangement, not a sub-grant. A contract would not be able to be counted toward the 25% requirement for sub-grants, even if it is for an amount of $5000 or less.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-68&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;May an applicant use a contractor’s services to perform work on part of the proposed project?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-68&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Yes. The applicant may hire a contractor for part of the work of the project as long as all federal rules and procedures (or state rules, if the applicant is a state agency) for procurement are followed.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-69&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;Under this grant program, may a for-profit company be included as a partner? &lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-69&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Yes. A for-profit company may be included as a partner as long as the grantee (prime recipient) does not enter the partnership with the intent to hire the for-profit company to provide goods or services that are available in the commercial marketplace in order to obtain those goods and services in a non-competitive transaction.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-70&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;May an applicant contract with a non-profit organization to do work on a proposed project? &lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-70&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Yes. Work on a proposed project may be contracted out to a non-profit organization as long as all federal rules and procedures (or state rules, if the applicant is a state agency) for procurement are followed.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-71&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;May a partner or contractor provide any or all of the required minimum 25% non-federal match?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-71&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Yes. A partner or contractor may provide any or all of the required minimum 25% non-federal match provided the costs they are covering are allowable under 40 CFR 30.23 or 40 CFR 31.24 for third party contributions. Contributions to matching funds may include cash, volunteer services, and donated supplies and equipment. Please note that a third party’s indirect costs may not be counted toward a cost share.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-72&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;What are you looking for in the Partnership Letters of Commitment?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-72&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The letter the partner writes to verify their partnership must clearly state how they are to be involved in the development, design or implementation of the project. It is very important that partners provide letters that clearly describe the role they will play in the proposed project. If funds, equipment/supplies or in-kind services will be provided, the dollar amounts or specific equipment/supplies or kinds of services need to be described specifically and in detail in the letter.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;It is not enough to simply name partners in the proposal. All partners must provide letters of commitment or they will not be given consideration by reviewers. If no letters are provided, it will be assumed there are no partners for the project.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-73&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;Do I need recommendation or endorsement letters in my proposal in order to be considered?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-73&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;No. Only submit letters from partner organizations making a commitment to the project. Please do not submit letters that simply recommend or endorse the project. Only letters of commitment from a partner organization, if applicable, will be considered in evaluating proposals.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-74&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;Do we have to have a partner for our proposed project?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-74&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;No. Applicants are not required to form partnerships for a proposed project to receive a grant from this program. However, it is important to note that EPA’s EE Grants Program considers partnerships to be a valuable contribution to the success of most projects. See Section V of the RFP for scoring factors or evaluation criteria.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;If you do not have any partners for your project, be sure to explain in your proposal how you anticipate reaching your goals successfully on your own.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-75&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;Does my project have to include a sub-grant program?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-75&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Yes. Each project must include a sub-grant program and a description of how the applicant plans on using the sub-grant program to achieve its project goals, and how it plans to ensure that &lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt; EXACTLY (no more than, no less than) 25% of the EPA funds&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt; awarded will be used &lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;for sub-grants of $5000 or less&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt; to eligible sub-grantees. Proposals must also explain how the prime recipient will select the sub-grantees and monitor the sub-grantees&#039; activities, materials, and delivery methods to ensure that they contribute to the project&#039;s expected outputs and outcomes and are in alignment with its educational and environment priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-76&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;How much of the funds awarded to the prime recipient (grantee) must go toward sub-grants?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-76&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Each recipient (the prime recipient) of a grant under this solicitation will be required to award &lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt; EXACTLY (no more and no less than) 25%&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt; of the funds received from EPA to eligible sub-grantees in the form of &lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;sub-grants of $5000 or less.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-76.2&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;Would the prime recipient be allowed to award sub-grants for more than $5000 with either EPA funds or with their own matching funds?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Generally not. Awarding sub-grants that total more than $5000 to one organization designated as a sub-grantee in the project&#039;s $5000 or less sub-grant program in most cases would violate the requirement of the National Environmental Education Act. There may be cases, however, in which one entity may receive more than one sub-grant and still have one or more of those $5000 or less sub-grants count toward the required 25% sub-grant program as long as the prime recipient can demonstrate that each sub-grant is for a distinctly separate and different task fulfilling different goals or objectives of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-76.3&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;Would the prime recipient be allowed to award BOTH a sub-grant for $5000 or less from EPA funds AND a sub-grant for more than $5000 from EPA funds to the same sub-grantee? &lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Generally not. Awarding sub-grants that total more than $5000 to one organization designated as a sub-grantee in the project&#039;s $5000 or less sub-grant program in most cases would violate the requirement of the National Environmental Education Act. There may be cases, however, in which one entity may receive more than one sub-grant and still have one or more of those $5000 or less sub-grants count toward the required 25% sub-grant program as long as the prime recipient can demonstrate that each sub-grant is for a distinctly separate and different task fulfilling different goals or objectives of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-76.4&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;We are planning a two year project. If we award a sub-grant to an organization for $5000 as part of the required $5000 or less sub-grant program the first year of our project, can we then give the same organization another sub-grant from EPA funds the second year for $5000 or less?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Generally not. Once the prime has designated an organization as a sub-grantee in the project’s required sub-grant program (in which exactly 25% of EPA funds must be expended on sub-grants of $5000 or less), then generally a maximum of $5000 in EPA funds can be awarded in sub-grant(s) to that organization, regardless of the project’s duration. For example, if a prime were to give a $3000 sub-grant from EPA funds to organization X the first year of a two-year project and $2000 the second year, the $5000 or less requirement will have been met. If organization X were to receive a sub-grant from EPA funds the second year for more than $2000 (e.g., $2500), then the $5000 limit will have been exceeded, which violates the terms of the agreement with the EE Grant Program, unless the prime recipient can demonstrate that each sub-grant is for a distinctly separate and different task fulfilling different goals or objectives of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-77&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;If awarded the grant, am I responsible for ensuring the awardees of the sub-grants are eligible for funds?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-77&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Yes. The prime recipient of the grant funds must ensure that all sub-grants they award with funds from this program go to entities that would qualify as &quot;eligible applicants.&quot; More information on eligibility can be found in Section III of the RFP.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-78&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;We are a university that is considering applying for an EE grant. Can we make sub-grants internally within the university?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-78&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, depending on how a university’s system is set up. Such situations will be decided on a case-by-case basis. Universities that are considering applying as a prime recipient and awarding sub-grants to sub-recipients within their university should contact &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:eegrants@epa.gov&quot;&gt;EEGrants@EPA.gov&lt;/a&gt; and explain their particular situation before submitting a proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-79&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;When I apply do I need to know and have outlined in the proposal (or complete application for selected finalists) which entities or organizations will receive sub-grants?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-79&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;No. The applicant does not have to know to whom they will be awarding sub-grants at the time they submit their proposal/or complete application for selected finalists. However, proposals must outline the process and criteria that will be used for selecting the sub-grantees.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-80&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;Do I have to make the sub-grantees compete for the sub-grants?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-80&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;No. EPA does not require the prime to run a competition for the sub-grants.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-82&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;Our organization is made up of affiliate chapters. Could we give sub-grants to our chapters to implement our project?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-82&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Yes. An applicant can make sub-grants of $5000 or less to their chapters to implement the project, assuming that the chapters are all eligible entities as defined in Section III of the RFP.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;pagetop&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#main-content&quot;&gt;Top of Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-84&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;No. Proposals submitted to grants.gov after the submission deadline (or hand delivered or postmarked after the deadline, if an applicant has been granted an exception) will be considered late and given no further consideration unless the applicant can clearly demonstrate that it was late due to EPA mishandling or because of technical problems associated with www.grants.gov.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-85&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;How do I submit a proposal for the EE Grant Program?&lt;/a&gt;

		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-93&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Yes. An example of a basic logic model with broad outputs and outcomes is in Appendix D of the RFP. A template that you can use to create your own specific version of a Logic Model that complements your project can be found on the &lt;a href=&quot;/education/environmental-education-ee-grants&quot;&gt;main EE Grants webpage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;

		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-95&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Yes. The Work Plan may not exceed 8 single-spaced pages. The entire narrative portion of the Work Plan (Project Summary, Detailed Project Description, and Project Evaluation) cannot exceed 8 single-spaced pages. Be precise, but also concise. Additional pages past the 8th page will not be reviewed with the proposal, potentially rendering it incomplete or incomprehensible. In addition, do not send extra material, such as videos, newspaper articles, etc.—they will not be reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-96&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;Can the proposal be longer than is specified?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-96&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;No. A page limit of 8 pages is specified in Section IV of the RFP. Additional pages past the 8th page will not be reviewed with the proposal, potentially rendering it incomplete or incomprehensible. In addition, do not send extra material, such as videos, newspaper articles, etc.—they will not be reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-97&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;Do the Detailed Budget and the Appendices count towards the 8 page limit?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-97&quot;&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-98&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;Are there limits on page and font size?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-98&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Yes. One page refers to one side of a single-spaced page on 8 1/2 by 11 inch typed in a font size no smaller than 10 point.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-99&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;Can I reorder the format of my proposal from the outline provided?&lt;/a&gt;

		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-100&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;To identify the appropriate Congressional District, go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.house.gov&quot;&gt;www.house.gov.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-101&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;Where can I find instructions for filling out SF-424 A- Budget?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-101&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;There are instructions for filling out SF-424 A-Budget in Appendix A of the RFP.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-102&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;Where can I find instructions for filling out SF-424- Application for Federal Assistance?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-102&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;There are instructions for filling out SF-424- Application for Federal Assistance in Appendix A of the RFP.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-103&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;What details of the project must the Work Plan include?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-103&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The 8-page Work Plan includes the following sections (please see Section IV of the RFP for complete descriptions of what each section should include.) Each section should be clearly labeled in your proposal. The Work Plan should be comprehensive and clear to a person unfamiliar with your project. Do not use acronyms and technical or specialized terms without defining them.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Project Summary&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Detailed Project Description (the What, Why, How, and Who of the Project)&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Project Evaluation&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-104&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;Can I reorder paragraphs within the subsections of the Detailed Project Description?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-104&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;You may reorder the paragraphs within the subsections of the Detailed Project Description (the What, Why, How and Who) but they must include the correct headings or you risk the possibility of information being overlooked when the project is scored.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-105&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;If I have previously received federal funding from the EPA&#039;s EE Grant Program should I include that in my proposal?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-105&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Yes. In the Project Summary section of your Work Plan, please note any projects previously funded by the EPA&#039;s EE Grant Program, and also list all of the previously EPA funded projects your organization has received in the past 3 years. In addition, all these previously funded grants should be labeled as &quot;EPA EE Grants&quot; under the Past Performance section of your proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-106&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;Do you have any additional suggestions of what to do to maximize the effectiveness of our proposal?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-106&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;In addition to reading and following the instructions in the RFP very carefully, we suggest that you perform an internal and/or external review on the proposal for clarity and conciseness. We recommend that you check the proposal for typographical, grammatical, and mathematical errors and perform a final quality control check to ensure that all proposal materials are complete and signed, and that the copies are legible.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-107&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;When and how will I be notified about the status of my proposal?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-107&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Regarding receipt of your proposal:&lt;br /&gt;
				Applicants will receive a confirmation that EPA has received their proposal after EPA has entered information about all applicants into a database. If you have not received confirmation of receipt from EPA (not www.grants.gov) within 60 days of the proposal deadline, please contact the appropriate Regional or HQ EPA staff as identified in Section VII of the relevant announcement. Failure to confirm that your proposal has been received may result in your proposal not being reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Regarding eligibility determination:&lt;br /&gt;
				Applicants will be notified of ineligibility status within 15 days of the determination being made.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Regarding selection or non-selection for a grant award:&lt;br /&gt;
				Specific dates are not available for when EPA will make decisions and contact (usually by email) the highest scoring finalists and send non-selection notifications to the others because of the variations in circumstances from Region to Region.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Note: Notification of receipt of proposals, as well as non-eligibility, selection and non-selection notification will be sent to the individual identified on line #21 of the SF424.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note:&lt;/em&gt; Notification of receipt of proposals, as well as non-eligibility, selection and non-selection notification will be sent to the individual identified on line #21 of the SF424.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;pagetop&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#main-content&quot;&gt;Top of Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Cost requirements and uses of grant funds.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;accordion&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-108&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;Are we required to use part of the funding we receive from the EPA EE Grants Program for sub-grants?&lt;/a&gt;

		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-108&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Yes. All applicants for grants are required to propose to award &lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt; EXACTLY 25% (no more and no less) of the dollar request from EPA&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/em&gt;in the form of sub-grants of $5000 or less (See FAQs on the Roles of the Prime, Partners, Contractors, and Sub-grantees). Since the National Environmental Education Act requires that exactly 25% of the EE grants budget be spent on awards of $5000 or less, EPA’s EE Grant Program is very strict about this amount being EXACT in the applicant’s proposed budget and in any prime recipient’s enacted budget.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-109&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;Do the sub-grants have to be in the form of cash or can we award educational materials that we purchase and distribute?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-109&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Yes. The sub-grant must be a cash award. You may not use education materials that you have purchased as the sub-grant in place of a cash award.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-110&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;Is there a cost sharing (match) requirement for this grant program? &lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-110&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Yes. There is a cost share (match) requirement for the EE Grant Program. Applicants must demonstrate how they will provide non-federal funding matching funds of &lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;at least 25%&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt; of the TOTAL cost of the project. To determine your minimum match requirement, calculate how much you will spend on the entire project from beginning to end, including both federal funds and your own funds, and divide this number by 4. The applicant may propose more than the required 25% match if they choose but should keep in mind that whatever dollar amount an applicant gives in a proposal as the matching funds will be the amount they are obligated to provide during the life of the grant.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The matching funds &lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;cannot&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt; be from a federal source (e.g., from another federal grant). The funds can be either in cash or in-kind services (e.g., volunteer hours), and can be from the applicant or from partner(s).&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-111&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;In the proposal do I need to state where the non-federal matching funds for my project will come from?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-111&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Yes. Applicants must demonstrate how the applicant will meet the match requirement in the proposal in order to be eligible for funding consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-112&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;Are salaries allowed as matching funds? Is there any limit to the percentage of requested grant funds that can be used for salaries? Is there a specific way that salaries need to be stated in the matching funds section?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-112&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Yes. Salaries can be used as a match and there is no set limit. It is suggested you be as specific and detailed in the Detailed Budget as possible when describing the salaries being covered by matching funds being salaries or being requested to be covered by grant funds – e.g., give the name(s) and title(s) of the person(s) whose salary is being listed, plus their normal salary and the percentage of their time being spent on the project. Be reasonable in your requests for personnel costs, as well as travel and overhead expenses, so your budget is competitive. Explain clearly in your Work Plan why and how the persons whose salaries are in the budget will be employed on the project.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-113&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;Do the required matching funds have to be in cash, or can they be in-kind donations and services, e.g., a volunteer’s or teacher’s time working on the project?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-113&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Either is acceptable. In-kind contributions of services, and other items like equipment, can count toward the required 25% cost match. Please see Section IV(C) (4) of the RFP for a complete matching funds explanation. As stated in the RFP, “the match must be for an allowable cost and may be provided by the applicant or a partner organization or institution. The match may be provided in cash or by in-kind contributions and other non-monetary support.”&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-114&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;Can office equipment be used as an in-kind match?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-114&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Yes. Office equipment can be used as an in-kind match as long as the cost is a relatively small percentage of the total amount of the match and the equipment is necessary for the achievement of the project’s goals. Costs and relevance of the equipment must be explained in the Detailed Budget. Note that if the equipment is not provided at the level of costs outlined in the proposal, then that part of the match must be accounted for in some other way during the project period – e.g., direct funds or in-kind services.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-115&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;Can the non-federal matching funds be provided by a partner? &lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-115&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Yes. Applicants may ask partners to assist with matching funds requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-116&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;If a tribal program becomes a partner in the EE grant proposal and already receives funds from another office in EPA, do those funds become tribal and therefore become eligible for use as part of the entire required 25% match?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-116&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;No. The funds from another EPA office are still federal funds and may not be used as any part of the required 25% match.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-117&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;What is “program income” and how and when may it be used by the recipient?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-117&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Program income is defined as the money a grant recipient earns as a direct result of a grant-supported activity. For example, registration fees charged for any conference or training course supported with grant funds are considered program income. A terms and conditions document will be issued by the Project Officer after an award is made to indicate how the program income shall be used. In most cases, program income will be used to pay for specified grant costs that are eligible and allowable and that further the project’s goals.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-118&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;May an applicant use program income as part of their non-federal cost share/match?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-118&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Yes. Program income can be used to finance the non-federal cost share (match) of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-119&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;What is the limit for indirect costs under the matching funds category?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-119&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The only limit on using indirect costs as part of the 25% match is the limit set by the indirect cost rate agreement the applicant has with the federal government. Indirect costs can be used as a match only when the applicant has an indirect cost rate agreement in place with the federal government, and therefore the dollar amount to be used as match cannot exceed the amount limited by the agreed upon rate.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-120&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;What is an Indirect Cost Rate?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-120&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;An Indirect Cost Rate is a percentage of an organization’s costs allowed for overhead and administrative expenses, determined to be fair within the boundaries of sound administrative principles.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-121&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;What is an Indirect Cost Rate Agreement?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-121&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;An Indirect Cost Rate Agreement is a negotiated agreement between a grant recipient and the cognizant Federal agency which identifies the fairness and basis of the indirect cost rate.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-122&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;Does an applicant have to have an Indirect Cost Rate Agreement in place when they apply for funds from this grants program?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-122&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;No. An applicant does not have to have an Indirect Cost Rate Agreement in place when they apply for a grant. Applicants can begin the negotiations for an Indirect Cost Rate Agreement at the same time that they apply for a grant to this program, or within 90 days of the date of an award of a grant under this solicitation. However, recipients are not allowed to seek reimbursement for indirect costs until an approved indirect cost rate is obtained.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-123&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;What if I don’t have an Indirect Cost Rate Agreement?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-123&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;If the recipient is a 501(c)(3)non-profit and does not have a current negotiated indirect cost rate agreement or proposal, and if EPA is the recipient’s cognizant agency, EPA can allow the recipient to charge a flat indirect cost rate of 10% of salaries and wages. Recipients that opt to use the 10% flat rate are obligated to use the flat rate for the life of the grant award.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-124&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;If an applicant does not have an Indirect Cost Rate Agreement with the government, what costs cannot be included in their proposed budget?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-124&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;If there is no Indirect Cost Rate Agreement, indirect costs such as administration, office rental, utilities, or security costs cannot be included in the proposed budget.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-125&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;Our university has a large indirect cost rate. If we reduce our indirect cost rate can the amount reflected in the use of a lowered indirect cost rate be counted toward the matching requirement in this grant program?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-125&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Yes. This would be an in-kind match, and could be used as a match as long as it is consistent with in-kind match principles. You will need to provide a written copy of the university’s current negotiated cost rate agreement with the proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-126&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;When is it allowable for a grant recipient to use grant funds to pay for meals?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-126&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Generally, when a speaker or a presentation/panel is provided or other work is being done during breakfast or lunch at a conference/workshop or field trip, it is allowable to use grant funds to pay for meals for the participants. It is also generally allowable to use grant funds to pay for light refreshments/snacks offered during breaks at conferences/workshops or field trips. The specific event at which meals and/or light refreshments/snacks will be provided must be described in the scope of work and the plan for the event, including the provision for refreshments AND &lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;must be pre-approved by the Project Officer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Meals and light refreshments provided at a grant recipient’s staff meetings are not allowable, nor are refreshments for evening receptions. Meals and receptions where alcohol is served are not allowable even if the grant funds are not used for the alcohol. Generally, banquets (especially evening banquets) paid for with grant funds are not allowed, nor is any EPA-funded entertainment. Also not allowed are any sort of EPA-funded events that conduct any fund-raising or involve strategies to solicit contributions, endowments, gifts or bequests.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Please note that a determination of reasonableness and necessity of costs for light refreshments/snacks and meals will be made on a case by case basis and included in a Terms and Conditions document at the time of the award of a grant.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-127&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;What is the difference between the Budget we must provide on the form 424A and the Detailed Budget narrative that the RFP also requires us to include?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-127&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The Budget form (SF-424A) is a standard government form that must be included in every grant proposal or application made to a federal grant program. It asks for dollar amounts in specified categories (such as Federal Funds and Non-Federal Funds) for particular line items (such as Personnel, Travel, Supplies, etc.). A Detailed Budget can be presented in any format (i.e., no particular form is required) but must include the same dollar amounts in the same categories and line items as the 424A, &lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;in much greater detail,&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt; with an accompanying narrative about how those funds will be used. For example, for Personnel in a Detailed Budget, an applicant should identify not only the dollar amount to be spent on this line item, but also the personnel who will be paid (or will volunteer) to staff and manage the project, including names, titles and roles, and how much of their time will be spent working on the project. For Travel, identify not only the dollar amounts to be spent, but also who will be traveling, to where, and what the costs will entail (e.g., airfare, hotel rooms, meals, etc.) Every line item should be presented in this level of detail in the Detailed Budget. (See Appendix B of the RFP for an Example of a Detailed Budget.) Be sure to &lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;check both the SF 424A and the Detailed Budget for mathematical errors before submitting them.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Make sure all &lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;line item and total dollar amounts are the same in both budgets&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. And, make certain that un-allowed items, such as construction costs, are not included in either budget.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;pagetop&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#main-content&quot;&gt;Top of Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Award Information&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;accordion&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-128&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;Will my proposal be penalized if I don&#039;t have any past performance or experience with federal funding?&lt;/a&gt;

		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-128&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;No. Applicants who do not have any relevant or available past performance or past reporting information must indicate this in the appropriate section of their proposal and will receive a neutral score for these sub-factors. However, if you do not provide any response about past performance or experience with federal funding, you may receive a score of 0 for these factors.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-129&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;What is the length of a project period? &lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-129&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;EPA will accept proposals for one or two year project periods. The proposal must demonstrate clearly how the project will be completed in the time frame proposed.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-130&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;If my project period is two years, instead of one, will I receive additional funding? &lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-130&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;No. EPA total funding will be the same regardless of project period (e.g., If a two-year project is proposed for $91,000, the award amount is $91,000 for the two-year period. No additional funding will be issued for the second year.)&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-131&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;Is this grant intended for projects that can be fully completed through the use of the EPA grant? In other words, at the end of the grant period, will EPA expect to see a project fully completed through the use of its funds or can EPA funding be one source among many, to produce a project whose costs exceed the amount requested from EPA and may take more than 2 years to complete?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-131&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Regardless of how much a project costs or how long it takes, the portion of the project that is funded by EPA must be completed in the given time associated with the grant funds; i.e., 1 to 2 years, whichever is requested in the proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-132&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;Are there any circumstances where awardees will receive only partial funding for projects?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-132&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Yes. In appropriate circumstances, EPA reserves the right to partially fund proposals by funding discrete portions or phases of a proposed project. If EPA decides to partially fund a proposal, it will do so in a manner that does not prejudice any applicants or affect the basis upon which the proposal or portion thereof, was evaluated or selected for award, and therefore maintains the integrity of the competition and selection process.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;pagetop&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#main-content&quot;&gt;Top of Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;post&quot; id=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Post award information&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;accordion&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-133&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;Is there more emphasis on reporting quantitative outputs (number of workshops or number of people educated) than on measurable outcomes (project participants becoming environmental stewards in the way they live their lives)?&lt;/a&gt;

		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-133&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;No. EPA values both quantitative outputs and measurable outcomes. Both should be included in the Logic Model in a grant proposal and reported in the semi-annual and final reports.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-134&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;Do I need to report on outputs and outcomes to the EPA during the project period?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-134&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Yes. Outputs and short-term outcomes must be reported to EPA within the project period. Appendix D in the RFP includes more detailed information on expected outputs and outcomes from environmental education grants.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-135&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;What are the general reporting requirements for an EE grant?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-135&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Grantees are required to provide quarterly reports that give a brief summary of the progress, semi-annual reports that give more detailed indices of progress (including budget), and a final report that is very detailed and includes discussion of outputs, outcomes and budget.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-136&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;If a grantee produces a project such as a video, curriculum or guide and the development time is funded by the EPA, does the grantee retain the copyright on the product for future sale or distribution?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-136&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;No. The product would be EPA’s if EPA provided grant funds to produce it. It would not be the property of the entity that prepared the product.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;pagetop&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#main-content&quot;&gt;Top of Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Information specific to the 2016 EE Local Grants RFP&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;accordion&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-149&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;What is the deadline for submission of a proposal?&lt;/a&gt;

		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-149&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;All submissions for the EE Local Grants RFP MUST be made electronically through grants.gov and must be received by 11:59 pm, April 8, 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-150&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;What are the funding limits for the EE Local Grant RFP?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-150&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Proposals for these grants must be for approximately but no more than $91,000 in federal funds or the application will be rejected. Applications requesting funds outside of these limits will be deemed ineligible and will not be reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-151&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;What type of grants will be awarded in the Regions?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-151&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;EPA Regions will be awarding grants that focus on local EE projects. Recipients of these grants will be required to award &lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;EXACTLY 25% of the funds they receive from EPA&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt; to sub-grants of $5000 or less. For example, if a recipient of a grant from this RFP is awarded $91,000, then that recipient must award &lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;exactly&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt; $22,750 in sub-grants of $5000 or less.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-152&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;Does the EE Local Grant RFP provide funds for the entire project?&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-152&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;No. Applicants are required to provide matching funds of &lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;at least 25% of the TOTAL&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt; cost of the project. To determine your minimum match requirement, calculate how much you will spend on the entire project from beginning to end, including both federal funds and your own funds, and divide this number by 4. For example, if the total cost of the project is $121,333, then the &lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;minimum &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt;match would be $30,333, and the request to EPA would be for $91,000.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-153&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;Who makes the selection for grants? &lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-153&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;A Selection Official in each of the EPA&#039;s 10 Regional Offices will make the final selections for grants awarded from the EE Local Grant RFP.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;accordion-title&quot; href=&quot;#pane-154&quot; title=&quot;Click to expand answer&quot;&gt;How are proposals evaluated? &lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;accordion-pane&quot; id=&quot;pane-154&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;All proposals will be evaluated for eligibility and all eligible proposals will be reviewed using a 100 point scale by review panels. The ten Regional Offices will each establish a review panel in each respective region to review the eligible proposals sent to them under the EE Local Grant RFP. The panel will include reviewers knowledgeable in the field of environmental education and will be comprised of EPA staff and/or external peer reviewers approved by the EPA. Proposals will be reviewed and scored based on specific criteria established for each section of the proposal, and then will be ranked based on the reviewers&#039; scores, and the scores and rankings will be provided to the EPA Regional Selection Official(s) for final funding decisions. More information can be found in Section V of the RFP.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>National Network for Environmental Management Studies Fellowship Program</title>
    <link>https://www.epa.gov/education/national-network-environmental-management-studies-fellowship-program</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;warning&quot;&gt;The National Network for Environmental Management Studies Fellowship (NNEMS) program is no longer active at EPA&lt;/span&gt;.  The information below may be useful as a reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the NNEMS program was to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Provide students with practical research opportunities and experiences in an EPA office or laboratory&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Increase public awareness of and involvement in environmental issues&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Encourage qualified individuals to pursue environmental careers&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Help defray the costs associated with the pursuit of academic programs related to the field of environmental protection, such as pollution control, science, engineering, technology, social science, and specialty areas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NNEMS program offered fellowships developed and sponsored by the EPA Headquarters office in Washington, D.C. and in the EPA’s 10 regional offices and laboratories throughout the United States. The projects were specifically narrow in scope, allowing students to complete the fellowship while working full-time at the EPA during the summer or part-time during the school year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For other fellowship opportunities, please visit EPA&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;/careers&quot;&gt;Careers&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/p&gt;
