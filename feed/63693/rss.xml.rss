			&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recognition is an important part of the Federal Green Challenge. Awards were given at the regional level in the categories of Purchasing, Waste, and Energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Pacific Northwest and Alaska region, the 2016 award winners are the Bonneville Power Administration and General Services Administration (GSA) Region 10. Below are descriptions of what the awardees achieved and/or how they achieved reductions.&lt;/p&gt;

To achieve this reduction, BPA networked all printers, installed monitoring through card and password access and removed all single desk printers. BPA also standardized and implemented a virtualized desktop environment with mobile thin clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally in FY15, BPA increased their recycling efforts by 71 percent. This increase was mainly accomplished by diverting obsolete and aging ceramic and glass insulators from the landfill to certified recycling centers. By actively supporting and engaging internal BPA customers, the Investment Recovery Center (IRC) and Supply Chain Services were able to ship these insulators from remote regions that did not offer glass/ceramic recycling to IRC facility and local Portland, Oregon recycling vendors. On one of the largest projects, BPA was also able to recycle a large amount of surplus copper wire with the insulators. This not only paid for the glass and ceramic recycling fees, but also recovered funds that BPA was able to credit back to BPA’s General Fund, in turn crediting the rate payers.&lt;/p&gt;

In response to increased vacancy, which is due to government space consolidation, GSA Region 10 has been aggressively assessing its needs, adjusting set points in vacant spaces, modifying mechanical systems and reducing inventory which has led to dramatic reduction of heating and cooling energy use.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recognition is an important part of the Federal Green Challenge (FGC). Awards were given at the regional level in the categories of Energy, Outreach and Education, Innovation, and Electronics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Pacific Southwest region, the 2016 award winners are the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Weather Forecast Office, U.S. Forest Service Region 5, and Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) Southwest Laboratory. Below are descriptions of what the awardees achieved and/or how they achieved reductions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;highlighted clear-right&quot;&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;energy&quot; name=&quot;energy&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Energy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Department of Interior, Golden Gate National Recreation Area, San Francisco, California&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span
    class=&quot;figure image file file-image file-image-png right view-mode-media_original&quot; style=&quot;width:92px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;2016 Award Icon&quot; title=&quot;2016 Federal Green Challenge Award Winners&quot; height=&quot;92&quot; width=&quot;92&quot; class=&quot;right media-element file-media-original&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;/sites/production/files/2016-06/fgc-2016-trophy.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;In 2015, Golden Gate National Recreation Area (GGNRA) made significant strides to reduce its carbon footprint with the goal of becoming a carbon-neutral park. The greatest achievement is in their use of renewable energy through a combination of on-site solar, plus purchase of 100 percent renewable energy for park buildings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GGNRA installed solar photovoltaics (PV) at their Fort Mason Headquarters building, as well as on Alcatraz Island. The solar PV’s provide up to 10 percent of the annual energy usage on their building and generates half of the annual energy usage on the island. In addition, GGNRA participates in Marin Clean Energy&#039;s &quot;Deep Green&quot; program which helped them to purchase 100 percent renewable energy for all of their buildings, accounting for over half of their annual energy usage. Combined, these efforts have resulted in 56 percent of their annual energy being renewable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Weather Forecast Office, Guam&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span

They focused on reducing their overall waste where they could achieve significant results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They replaced their old water heater and conserved energy by installing automatic motion sensors in frequently unoccupied rooms such as the storage and mail rooms. In addition, they stocked their break room with reusable dishes and silverware donated by the employees, which helped reduce the use of disposable paper and plastic ware. Next, they implemented collection points for recyclable items, and installed collection bins on their floors and in the copy room. The dedicated collection points made it easier for employees to recycle and made it clear that individual actions can make a big difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;highlighted&quot;&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;Innov&quot; name=&quot;Innov&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Innovation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service Region 5, Vallejo, California&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span
    class=&quot;figure image file file-image file-image-png right view-mode-media_original&quot; style=&quot;width:92px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;2016 Award Icon&quot; title=&quot;2016 Federal Green Challenge Award Winners&quot; height=&quot;92&quot; width=&quot;92&quot; class=&quot;right media-element file-media-original&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;/sites/production/files/2016-06/fgc-2016-trophy.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;In 2015, the U.S. Forest Service Region 5 performed innovative, low-cost energy and water audits. The audits informed facility energy and water conservation priorities, which contributed to compliance with Executive Order 13693 -- Planning for Federal Sustainability in the Next Decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Forest Service Region 5 partnered with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ccc.ca.gov/Pages/default.aspx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;California Conservation Corps (CCC)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;exit-disclaimer&quot; href=&quot;/home/exit-epa&quot; title=&quot;EPA&#039;s External Link Disclaimer&quot;&gt;Exit &lt;/a&gt;to perform the audits of selected facilities. CCC members installed energy-efficient and clean energy systems, as well as water-saving devices, at the audited facilities. The CCC provides low-cost audit services in return for energy industry training opportunities for young adults in California. This is a win-win solution for both partners. By conducting audits in partnership with the CCC, Region 5 saved approximately $3,500 per audit, or $24,500 annually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;highlighted&quot;&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;elect&quot; name=&quot;elect&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Electronics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) Southwest Laboratory, Vista, California&lt;/h3&gt;

This year, the FGC participant significantly improved in the category of Electronics. They increased their acquisition of Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT)-registered equipment by 1,100 percent, from 2014 to 2015, and now possess 36 EPEAT Gold and Silver units. DEA verified both the EPEAT and ENERGY STAR status of each electronic unit to ensure sustainable procurement. The new EPEAT equipment replaced older computers, which the Laboratory donated to local colleges and universities.&lt;/p&gt;

In fiscal year 2015, their efforts resulted in a solid waste diversion rate of 67.91 percent due to  the recycling of 9.43 tons of commingled products, 1.4 tons of cardboard, 0.18 tons of toner cartridges, 0.21 tons of batteries, and 5.70 tons of unserviceable electronics. During the week of April 20, 2015, EPIC hosted a suite of education and outreach activities for their Earth Day Event. These activities included a question of the day, interactive training sessions on recycling and electric renewable energy technologies and a community walk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The annual EPIC Environmental Stewardship Guidance Directive provides guidance for employees. EPIC continued to encourage and promote green purchasing, sustainable acquisition, recycling, waste diversion and electronics stewardship. In addition, their outreach includes partnering with Fort Bliss (contributing to Fort Bliss’s net zero approach) and the El Paso, Texas communities to achieve their environmental goals. EPIC further stated that continuing their employee education program will improve the environmental performance at the national level law enforcement center.&lt;/p&gt;

Efforts were coordinated with the Engineering and Logistics Services to recycle construction debris, install renewable energy photovoltaic solar panels as an alternative energy source, and to manage electronic waste. This collaborative effort resulted in a total recycling net benefit of $398,149.96 and the NMVAHCS generated 21 percent of its energy from a renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recognition is an important part of the Federal Green Challenge. Awards were given at the regional level in the categories of Waste, Energy, Education and Outreach, Purchasing, Innovation, Electronics, Transportation, Water, and Leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Great Lakes region, the 2016 award winners are the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs (VA) Healthcare System, Minnesota National Guard, U.S. EPA Mid-Continent Ecology Division, U.S. Customs and Border Protection Detroit Field Office, and Naval Station Great Lakes. Below are descriptions of what the awardees achieved and/or how they achieved reductions.&lt;/p&gt;

These are very aggressive targets. The Facility Green Environmental Management System Program Manager working closely with the Environmental Management Section pushed the recycling rates of all materials up. A special focus was put on the work by the Engineering Projects section, which dramatically increased the rate of recycling C&amp;amp;D waste to more than 80 percent. Every contract for new projects or facility rehabilitation was given the new recycling goals and the results were closely measured to ensure compliance. At the end of the year, Minneapolis VA Healthcare System was surprised to find they had diverted more than 367 tons of C&amp;amp;D out of 450 tons generated compared to 66 tons out of 150 tons the year before.&lt;/p&gt;

Additionally, they improved pollinator habitat for butterflies and bees in 2015 by removing non-native species and adding additional native flowers and grasses to a portion of the campus converted to a northern upland meadow more than 10 years ago. The work has attracted birds and a variety of large and small mammals, in addition to pollinators, and has saved energy as the three and a half acres are no longer mowed.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recognition is an important part of the Federal Green Challenge. Awards were given at the regional level in the categories of Leadership and Energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Southeast region, the 2016 award winners are Department of Human Services’ U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Southeast Regional Office and Department of Energy’s East Tennessee Technology Park. Below are descriptions of what the awardees achieved and/or how they achieved reductions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;highlighted clear-right&quot;&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;lead&quot; name=&quot;lead&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Leadership&lt;/h2&gt;

This will lead to significant savings of an estimated $300,000 over 10 years. The change also decommissioned cooling requirements of approximately 12 tons of air conditioning capacity that no longer must be run 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The initial goal was to seek out a modest space reduction and reduced rent. However, there were many benefits associated with this including reduced electricity, water and waste consumption. This is also a major step forward in embracing smart growth principles as outlined by EPA. Additionally, this type of leadership will help prepare for the implementation of the 2030 net zero energy building requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

The ETTP also decreased their natural gas consumption by 43 percent to 2,229,800 cubic feet. In addition, a one-megawatt solar array was installed on-site to contribute renewable energy. Powerhouse Six, as it is called, is the third solar array at ETTP. The solar array will provide enough clean energy to power more than 100 average-sized homes per year while preventing pollution that is equivalent to removing 240 cars from the road annually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recognition is an important part of the Federal Green Challenge. Awards were given at the regional level in the categories of Leadership, Innovation, Waste, Purchasing, and Overall Achievement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Mid-Atlantic region, the 2016 award winners are the Department of Justice McDowell Federal Correctional Institution, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Coatesville VA Medical Center, Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary and James E. Van Zandt Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center. Below are descriptions of what the awardees achieved and/or how they achieved reductions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;highlighted&quot;&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;over&quot; name=&quot;over&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Overall Achievement&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;James E. Van Zandt VA Medical Center, Altoona, Pennsylvania&lt;/h3&gt;

They institute a robust waste management program with over 61 percent of their waste-stream being recycled. They use 20 percent less energy per square foot than hospitals nationwide with employment of occupancy sensors in offices and common areas, and designed natural light usage where practical. Their program also realized a 33 percent reduction in indoor water use through utility upgrades such as water sensors, flow control valves, timers and water restrictors. This 23.6 acre facility is situated at the upper reaches of the sensitive Chesapeake Bay drainage basin and seeks to provide the maximum pollution reduction and protections including the capture of 88 percent of precipitation through use of storm-ponds and rain gardens. This facility uses mulching mowers to compost 6.8 tons of grass and leaves saving both manpower costs and eliminating the need to irrigate and fertilize. Additional noteworthy accomplishments in FY15 include: sending 8.2 tons of end-of-life electronics to UNICOR, a third party certified recycler; diverting 409 tons out of 465 tons of C&amp;amp;D waste for a rate of 88 percent; and operating a growing fleet of five electric vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;highlighted clear-right&quot;&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;lead&quot; name=&quot;lead&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Leadership&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;McDowell Federal Correctional Institution, Welch, West Virginia&lt;/h3&gt;

FCI McDowell has a very large and efficient recycling program and seeks to continuously improve by implementing new ideas, equipment and systems. Other institutions often contact FCI McDowell for guidance and new ideas to help with their recycling program. FCI McDowell has an on-site center that recycles institutional trash on a daily basis, thereby eliminating waste going to the landfill and also uses a food digester machine to divert organic waste. They recycle many other materials including cardboard, paper, various grades of plastics, ferrous and nonferrous metals, milk cartons, clothing and more. FCI McDowell&#039;s recycling program reports a yearly efficiency rate at around 70 percent. The recycling operations also support the production of jobs for inmates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;FEMA, Washington, District of Columbia&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The District of Columbia area FEMA Office of the Chief Administrative Officer (OCAO), Sustainability Energy, Environmental and Asset Management Division and the National Emergency Training Center (NETC) jointly developed and implemented a series of pollution prevention and energy initiatives at facilities on the NETC, which has reduced FEMA’s overall facility operational cost, as well as waste generation and harmful greenhouse gas emissions. These efforts resulted in a 22 percent reduction in electricity consumption; 33 percent reduction in natural gas; 22.93 percent increase in ENERGY STAR building efficiency rating; 15 percent reduction in water consumption; and the establishment of a robust pollution prevention program highlighted by various recycling initiatives. Waste reduction initiatives are estimated to have helped the region reduce its waste generation by as much as 11,859 pounds of waste daily (1,542 tons annually). FEMA remains committed to the sustainable and efficient management of its agency’s operations.&lt;/p&gt;

They had a greater than 80 percent diversion rate for C&amp;amp;D waste due to recycling efforts at large projects that yielded high quantities of waste to be recycled including metal, masonry/plaster, drywall and ceiling tiles. The VA construction specifications require contractors to provide, as part of the bid submittal process, confirmation that where they will be sending waste is a proper recycling center. Without strong specifications, C&amp;amp;D debris could end up in a landfill, which was partially found to be the case by an audit conducted by the VA under a former contract. This VA Center works hard to maintain and enhance all aspects of their green environmental management system.&lt;/p&gt;

In addition to this approximate savings of one ton of paper, there is also a savings in energy and waste that is related with paper reduction due to the associated reduction of printing and disposal. This reduction was achieved by encouraging staff to save more documentation in electronic formats rather than printing and storing hard-copies. This facility also uses paper containing at least 30 percent recycled content which they purchase from a blind veteran&#039;s association.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recognition is an important part of the Federal Green Challenge (FGC). Awards were given at the regional level in the categories of Education and Outreach, and Leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Region 2, which serves New Jersey, New York, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, the 2016 award winners are Veterans Affairs Caribbean Healthcare Facility System (VACHS), Brookhaven National Laboratory, and General Services Administration (GSA) Region 2. Below are descriptions of what the awardees achieved and/or how they achieved reductions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;highlighted clear-right&quot;&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;eol&quot; name=&quot;eol&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Education and Outreach and Leadership&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Veterans Affairs Caribbean Healthcare Facility System (VACHS), San Juan, Puerto Rico&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span
    class=&quot;figure image file file-image file-image-png right view-mode-media_original&quot; style=&quot;width:92px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;2016 Award Icon&quot; title=&quot;2016 Federal Green Challenge Award Winners&quot; height=&quot;92&quot; width=&quot;92&quot; class=&quot;right media-element file-media-original&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;/sites/production/files/2016-06/fgc-2016-trophy.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;VACHS has established an aggressive strategic National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) implementation process into all construction project activities in their facilities. Environmental evaluation and assessment is integrated into all stages of the planning and implementation of design and construction of projects. Project managers are key components and steward leaders into a successful NEPA integration process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A NEPA training program was established as a performance goal measurement for this strategy. Project managers consisting of mechanical, electrical, civil and structural engineers; planners; and architects were selected as the target population. By completing NEPA training, project managers were able to acquire knowledge of the NEPA process, environmental regulations, permitting compliance and their overall roles and responsibilities to the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VACHS uses the environmental aspect/impact assessment scorecard methodology for significant determination. The implementation of the NEPA Training and Construction Waste Management was a successful tool to project managers in providing regulatory compliance awareness and responsibilities to the Green Environmental Management System Program. For fiscal year 2015 (FY15), a 100 percent of the projects met compliance with environmental regulatory requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VACHS has significantly increased recycling opportunities by reusing and donating construction materials generated from renovation projects. For example, in FY15, VACHS San Juan Medical Center Auditorium donated more than 3,000 auditorium chairs for a total of 1.6 tons. This action diverted solid waste from the landfill and benefited a nonprofit local elementary school near the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, by enhancing multidisciplinary participation and coordination efforts and procedures, VACHS has improved and established a positive working relationship between engineers, environmental staff and construction employees. They also continuously submit construction waste data into the Green Health Tracker Waste Management Program, and monitor waste management during Environment of Care Construction Inspections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All strategies implemented under this program can be expanded into all VA and other agencies, as demonstrated with the selection of the VACHS NEPA Environmental Evaluation form used as a reference tool in the VA Interim NEPA Guidance for Project.&lt;/p&gt;

Brookhaven Science Associates has completed the NSLS stabilization and hazard removal project that was part of an integrated plan for preparing the facility for its post-operations phase of the facility life cycle. Both phases of this plan—stabilization and hazard removal—were planned with the objective of recovering the value of NSLS assets to the extent practicable and enabling the facility to be reused for a new purpose. This plan and its execution were highly effective as evidenced by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;more than $76 million in NSLS equipment removed for reuse at NSLS-II, elsewhere on the Brookhaven National Laboratory campus or elsewhere in the Department of Energy (DOE) complex;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;almost 1.6 million pounds of material recycled with a return of more than $600,000 to the project; and&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;more than $200,000 in waste transportation and disposal costs avoided.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brookhaven National Laboratory&#039;s historical annual recycling rates have been in the 60 to 65 percent range, significantly above the Department of Energy’s sustainability goal of 50 percent. The magnitude of this project brought the laboratory’s annual recycling rate up to 74 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The planning process for the decommissioning of this facility resulted in significant amounts of materials to be reused, repurposed or recycled resulting in a minimum amount of waste. The process saved tax payers millions of dollars and all of this work was carefully planned without injury and with full respect for the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

GSA has been and continues to be committed to increasing the sustainability of its buildings and operations by reducing energy and water consumption and increasing waste diversion rates throughout Region 2. GSA has accomplished this through the concerted regional wide efforts of multiple project teams implementing programs and initiatives to increase sustainability and building performance while decreasing energy and water consumption. The work of multiple project teams thought the region has included Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design building certifications projects, compliance with the Guiding Principles for Sustainable Federal Buildings, American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) High Performance Green Building Full and Partial Building Modernization projects, ARRA High Performance Small and Limited Scope Green Building projects, building renovation and repair projects, commissioning and re-commissioning work, American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers Level II audits, Targeted Energy Efficiency Expert Evaluations (E4 program), Rapid Building Assessment and Energy Saving Performance Contract work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recognition is an important part of the Federal Green Challenge (FGC). Awards were given at the regional level in the categories of Leadership, Innovation, Water, and Waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the New England region, the 2016 award winners are the Manchester Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center, West Haven VA Medical Campus, and the U.S. Naval Undersea Warfare Center. Below are descriptions of what the awardees achieved and/or how they achieved reductions.&lt;/p&gt;

This is the second FGC award for this facility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Federal Food Recovery Opportunities and Planning to Meet EO13693 Objectives: 09/24/2015&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/03/19/executive-order-planning-federal-sustainability-next-decade&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Executive Order 13693, Planning for Federal Sustainability in the Next Decade&lt;/a&gt;, issued in March of 2015, calls on federal agencies to maintain leadership in sustainability and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. A key element of the order is to &quot;advance waste prevention and pollution prevention by . . . diverting at least 50 percent of non-hazardous solid waste, including food and compostable material . . &quot; Notably, wasted food constitutes the largest quantity of divertible material sent to landfills. Of the estimated 34 million tons thrown out, only 2.5 percent is diverted. Wasted food is estimated at 30-40% of the food supply and is the third largest source of methane gas, one of the most potent greenhouse gases responsible for trapping heat in the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Food recovery,&quot; which includes practices such as the purchase of less food, donation of edible food and composting, can significantly reduce waste to landfills. This webinar will outline why federal food purchasing matters and how to include food recovery into strategic planning and food service contracts and leases. It will also feature an example of how a federal and concessioner partnership successfully contributed to food recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Darby Hoover, Senior Resource Specialist, and JoAnne Berkenkamp, Senior Advocate, Food and Agriculture Program, Natural Resources Defense Council, will outline a five-point plan to help federal agencies strengthen business practices and identify high priority waste reduction strategies associated with food services. A representative from the National Park Service is expected to speak as well.&lt;/p&gt;
