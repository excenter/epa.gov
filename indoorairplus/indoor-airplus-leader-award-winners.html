		</ul><hr /><p>EPA had its first Indoor airPLUS recognition ceremony at RESNET's 2010 Building Performance Conference held Feb. 22-24, in Raleigh, N.C. The Indoor airPLUS program recognized seven verifier partners for outstanding leadership in verifying and promoting Indoor airPLUS certified homes. Out of 148 Indoor airPLUS verifier partners, these seven organizations led the way in certifying the most Indoor airPLUS homes. Their efforts are helping to create healthier and greener homes, advanced indoor air quality in residential construction and provide the many benefits that Indoor airPLUS qualified homes offer to homeowners and families.</p>

		<ul><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/EPAiaplus/videos/1451069158403/">Watch the video of the Award Ceremony</a></li>
		</ul><blockquote>
			<p>"The third party verification of the Indoor airPLUS label is huge, and that third party validation helps generate revenue for the raters. It also provides the builder with someone to take a look at each of those components making sure that those elements of Indoor airPLUS have been third party verified. If they are not involved with the program then they are missing an opportunity. Missing that opportunity means that you are not able to provide more services, so you've lost revenue." Kelly Parker, GWS Oklahoma.</p>
