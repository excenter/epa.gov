<p>Knowledge about air duct cleaning is in its early stages, so a blanket recommendation cannot be offered as to whether you should have your air ducts in your home cleaned. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) urges you to read this document in it entirety as it provides important information on the subject.</p>

<p>Duct cleaning has never been shown to actually prevent health problems. Neither do studies conclusively demonstrate that particle (e.g., dust) levels in homes increase because of dirty air ducts. This is because much of the dirt in air ducts adheres to duct surfaces and does not necessarily enter the living space. It is important to keep in mind that dirty air ducts are only one of many possible sources of particles that are present in homes. Pollutants that enter the home both from outdoors and indoor activities such as cooking, cleaning, smoking, or just moving around can cause greater exposure to contaminants than dirty air ducts. Moreover, there is no evidence that a light amount of household dust or other particulate matter in <i>air ducts</i> poses any risk to your health.</p>

<p>You should consider having the air ducts in your home cleaned if:</p>

	<p>Ducts are clogged with excessive amounts of dust and debris and/or particles are actually released into the home from your supply registers.</p>
</div>

<p>If any of the conditions identified above exists, it usually suggests one or more underlying causes. Prior to any cleaning, retrofitting, or replacing of your ducts, the cause or causes must be corrected or else the problem will likely recur.</p>

<p>Some research suggests that cleaning heating and cooling system components (e.g., cooling coils, fans and heat exchangers) may improve the efficiency of your system, resulting in a longer operating life, as well as some energy and maintenance cost savings. However, little evidence exists that cleaning only the ducts will improve the efficiency of the system.</p>

<p>You may consider having your air ducts cleaned simply because it seems logical that air ducts will get dirty over time and should be occasionally cleaned. Provided that the cleaning is done properly, no evidence suggests that such cleaning would be detrimental. EPA does not recommend that the air ducts be cleaned routinely, but only as needed. EPA does, however, recommend that if you have a fuel burning furnace, stove or fireplace, they be inspected for proper functioning and serviced before each heating season to protect against carbon monoxide poisoning.</p>

<p>If you do decide to have your air ducts cleaned, take the same consumer precautions you normally would in assessing the service provider's competence and reliability.</p>

<p>Air duct cleaning service providers may tell you that they need to apply chemical biocide to the inside of your ducts as a means to kill bacteria (germs) and fungi (mold) and prevent future biological growth. They may also propose the application of a "sealant" to prevent dust and dirt particles from being released into the air or to seal air leaks. You should fully understand the pros and cons of permitting application of chemical biocides or sealants. While the targeted use of chemical biocides and sealants may be appropriate under specific circumstances, research has not demonstrated their effectiveness in duct cleaning or their potential adverse health effects. No chemical biocides are currently registered by EPA for use in internally-insulated air duct systems (see <a href="should-you-have-air-ducts-your-home-cleaned.html#Should">Should chemical biocides be applied to the inside of air ducts?</a>).</p>

<p>Whether or not you decide to have the air ducts in your home cleaned, preventing water and dirt from entering the system is the most effective way to prevent contamination (see <a href="should-you-have-air-ducts-your-home-cleaned.html#how_to_prevent">How to Prevent Duct Contamination</a>).</p>

<hr /><h2 id="what-is">What is Air Duct Cleaning?</h2>

<p>Most people are now aware that indoor air pollution is an issue of growing concern and increased visibility. Many companies are marketing products and services intended to improve the quality of your indoor air. You have probably seen an advertisement, received a coupon in the mail, or been approached directly by a company offering to clean your air ducts as a means of improving your home's indoor air quality. These services typically — but not always — range in cost from $450 to $1,000 per heating and cooling system, depending on:<br />
	the services offered</p>

<ul><li>the size of the system to be cleaned</li>
	<li>system accessibility</li>
	<li>climatic region</li>
	<li>level of contamination</li>
</ul><div class="box simple">
	<div class="pane-content">
		<p>If you decide to have your heating and cooling system cleaned, it important to make sure the service provider agrees to clean all components of the system and is qualified to do so.</p>
	</div>
</div>

<p>Duct cleaning generally refers to the cleaning of various heating and cooling system components of forced air systems, including the supply and return air ducts and registers, grilles and diffusers, heat exchangers heating and cooling coils, condensate drain pans (drip pans), fan motor and fan housing, and the air handling unit housing (<a href="should-you-have-air-ducts-your-home-cleaned.html#upright%20indoor%20system%20graphic">See diagram</a>).</p>

<p>If not properly installed, maintained and operated, these components may become contaminated with particles of dust, pollen or other debris. If moisture is present, the potential for microbiological growth (e.g., mold) is increased and spores from such growth may be released into the home's living space. Some of these contaminants may cause allergic reactions or other symptoms in people if they are exposed to them. If you decide to have your heating and cooling system cleaned, it is important to make sure the service provider agrees to clean <i>all</i> components of the system and is qualified to do so. Failure to clean a component of a contaminated system can result in re-contamination of the entire system, thus negating any potential benefits. Methods of duct cleaning vary, although standards have been established by industry associations concerned with air duct cleaning. Typically, a service provider will use specialized tools to dislodge dirt and other debris in ducts, then vacuum them out with a high-powered vacuum cleaner.</p>

<p>In addition, the service provider may propose applying chemical biocides, designed to kill microbiological contaminants, to the inside of the duct work and to other system components. Some service providers may also suggest applying chemical treatments (sealants or other encapsulants) to encapsulate or cover the inside surfaces of the air ducts and equipment housings because they believe it will control mold growth or prevent the release of dirt particles or fibers from ducts. These practices have yet to be fully researched and you should be fully informed before deciding to permit the use of biocides or chemical treatments in your air ducts. They should only be applied, if at all, after the system has been properly cleaned of all visible dust or debris.</p>

<p>Note: Use of sealants to encapsulate the inside surfaces of ducts is a different practice than sealing duct air leaks. Sealing duct air leaks can help save energy on heating and cooling bills. For more information, see <a href="https://www.energystar.gov">EPA's Energy Star website</a>.</p>

<p>Knowledge about the potential benefits and possible problems of air duct cleaning is limited. Since conditions in every home are different, it is impossible to generalize about whether or not air duct cleaning in your home would be beneficial.</p>

<p>If no one in your household suffers from allergies or unexplained symptoms or illnesses and if, after a visual inspection of the inside of the ducts, you see no indication that your air ducts are contaminated with large deposits of dust or mold (no musty odor or visible mold growth), having your air ducts cleaned is probably unnecessary. It is normal for the return registers to get dusty as dust-laden air is pulled through the grate. This does not indicate that your air ducts are contaminated with heavy deposits of dust or debris; the registers can be easily vacuumed or removed and cleaned.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if family members are experiencing unusual or unexplained symptoms or illnesses that you think might be related to your home environment, you should discuss the situation with your doctor. EPA has published the following publications for guidance on identifying possible indoor air quality problems and ways to prevent or fix them.</p>

<ul><li><a href="indoor-air-pollution-introduction-health-professionals.html">Indoor Air Quality: An Introduction for Health Professionals</a></li>
	<li><a href="inside-story-guide-indoor-air-quality.html">The Inside Story: A Guide to Indoor Air Quality</a></li>
</ul><p>You may consider having your air ducts cleaned simply because it seems logical that air ducts will get dirty over time and should occasionally be cleaned. While the debate about the value of periodic duct cleaning continues, no evidence suggests that such cleaning would be detrimental, <i>provided that it is done properly</i>.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if a service provider fails to follow proper duct cleaning procedures, duct cleaning can cause indoor air problems. For example, an inadequate vacuum collection system can release more dust, dirt and other contaminants than if you had left the ducts alone. A careless or inadequately trained service provider can damage your ducts or heating and cooling system, possibly increasing your heating and air conditioning costs or forcing you to undertake difficult and costly repairs or replacements.</p>

	<h2>Other Important Considerations</h2>

	<p>Duct cleaning has never been shown to actually prevent health problems. Neither do studies conclusively demonstrate that particle (e.g., dust) levels in homes increase because of dirty air ducts or go down after cleaning. This is because much of the dirt that may accumulate inside air ducts adheres to duct surfaces and does not necessarily enter the living space. It is important to keep in mind that dirty air ducts are only one of many possible sources of particles that are present in homes. Pollutants that enter the home both from outdoors and indoor activities such as cooking, cleaning, smoking, or just moving around can cause greater exposure to contaminants than dirty air ducts. Moreover, there is no evidence that a light amount of household dust or other particulate matter in air ducts poses any risk to health.</p>

	<p>EPA does not recommend that air ducts be cleaned except on an as-needed basis because of the continuing uncertainty about the benefits of duct cleaning under most circumstances. EPA does, however, recommend that if you have a fuel burning furnace, stove, or fireplace, they be inspected for proper functioning and serviced before each heating season to protect against carbon monoxide poisoning. Some research also suggests that cleaning dirty cooling coils, fans and heat exchangers can improve the efficiency of heating and cooling systems. However, little evidence exists to indicate that simply cleaning the duct system will increase your system's efficiency.</p>

	<p>If you think duct cleaning might be a good idea for your home, but you are not sure, talk to a professional. The company that services your heating and cooling system may be a good source of advice. You may also want to contact professional duct cleaning service providers and ask them about the services they provide. Remember, they are trying to sell you a service, so ask questions and insist on complete and knowledgeable answers.</p>

	<hr /><h2 id="choosing">Suggestions for Choosing a Duct Cleaning Service Provider</h2>

	<p>To find companies that provide duct cleaning services, check your Yellow Pages under "duct cleaning" or contact the <a href="should-you-have-air-ducts-your-home-cleaned.html#nadca">National Air Duct Cleaners Association (NADCA)</a> at the address and phone number in the information section located at the end of this guidance. Do not assume that all duct cleaning service providers are equally knowledgeable and responsible. Talk to at least three different service providers and get written estimates before deciding whether to have your ducts cleaned. When the service providers come to your home, ask them to show you the contamination that would justify having your ducts cleaned.</p>

	<div>
		<div class="figure image left" style="width:15px"><img alt="checkmark" src="../sites/production/files/2014-07/checkmark.gif.html" style="width:15px" /></div>

		<p>Do not hire duct cleaners who make sweeping claims about the health benefits of duct cleaning — such claims are unsubstantiated. Do not hire duct cleaners who recommend duct cleaning as a <i>routine</i> part of your heating and cooling system maintenance. You should also be wary of duct cleaners who claim to be certified by EPA. Note: EPA neither establishes duct cleaning standards nor certifies, endorses, or approves duct cleaning companies.</p>

	<p>To prevent ducts from becoming wet:</p>

	<p>Moisture should not be present in ducts. Controlling moisture is the most effective way to prevent biological growth in air ducts.</p>

	<p>Moisture can enter the duct system through leaks or if the system has been improperly installed or serviced. Research suggests that condensation (which occurs when a surface temperature is lower than the dew point temperature of the surrounding air) on or near cooling coils of air conditioning units is a major factor in moisture contamination of the system. The presence of condensation or high relative humidity is an important indicator of the potential for mold growth on any type of duct. Controlling moisture can often be difficult, but here are some steps you can take:</p>

	<div>
		<div class="figure image left" style="width:15px"><img alt="checkmark" src="../sites/production/files/2014-07/checkmark.gif.html" style="width:15px" /></div>

		<p>Promptly and properly repair any leaks or water damage.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="clear-left">
		<div class="figure image left" style="width:15px"><img alt="checkmark" src="../sites/production/files/2014-07/checkmark.gif.html" style="width:15px" /></div>

		<p>Pay particular attention to cooling coils, which are designed to remove water from the air and can be a major source of moisture contamination of the system that can lead to mold growth. Make sure the condensate pan drains properly. The presence of substantial standing water and/or debris indicates a problem requiring immediate attention. Check any insulation near cooling coils for wet spots.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="clear-left">
		<div class="figure image left" style="width:15px"><img alt="checkmark" src="../sites/production/files/2014-07/checkmark.gif.html" style="width:15px" /></div>

		<p>Make sure ducts are properly sealed and insulated in all non-air-conditioned spaces (e.g., attics and crawl spaces). This will help to prevent moisture due to condensation from entering the system and is important to make the system work as intended. To prevent water condensation, the heating and cooling system must be properly insulated.</p>

	<div class="clear-left">
		<div class="figure image left" style="width:15px"><img alt="checkmark" src="../sites/production/files/2014-07/checkmark.gif.html" style="width:15px" /></div>

		<p>If you are replacing your air conditioning system, make sure that the unit is the proper size for your needs and that all ducts are sealed at the joints. A unit that is too big will cycle on and off frequently, resulting in poor moisture removal, particularly in areas with high humidity. Also make sure that your new system is designed to manage condensation effectively.</p>

	<hr /><h2 id="unresolved_issues">Unresolved Issues of Duct Cleaning</h2>

	<h3 id="Does">Does duct cleaning prevent health problems?</h3>

	<p>The bottom line is: no one knows. There are examples of ducts that have become badly contaminated with a variety of materials that may pose risks to your health. The duct system can serve as a means to distribute these contaminants throughout a home. In these cases, duct cleaning may make sense. However, a light amount of household dust in your air ducts is normal. Duct cleaning is not considered to be a necessary part of yearly maintenance of your heating and cooling system, which consists of regular cleaning of drain pans and heating and cooling coils, regular filter changes and yearly inspections of heating equipment. Research continues in an effort to evaluate the potential benefits of air duct cleaning.</p>

	<h3>In the meantime</h3>

	<div class="figure image left" style="width:15px"><img alt="checkmark" src="../sites/production/files/2014-07/checkmark.gif.html" style="width:15px" /></div>

	<p>Educate yourself about duct cleaning by contacting some or all of the sources of information listed at the end of this publication and asking questions of potential service providers.</p>

	<h3>Are duct materials other than bare sheet metal ducts more likely to be contaminated with mold and other biological contaminants?</h3>

	<p>You may be familiar with air ducts that are constructed of sheet metal. However, many modern residential air duct systems are constructed of fiber glass duct board or sheet metal ducts that are lined on the inside with fiber glass duct liner. Since the early 1970's, a significant increase in the use of flexible duct, which generally is internally lined with plastic or some other type of material, has occurred.</p>

	<p>The use of insulated duct material has increased due:</p>

	<ul><li>to improved temperature control</li>
		<li>energy conservation</li>
		<li>reduced condensation</li>
	</ul><p>Internal insulation provides better acoustical (noise) control. Flexible duct is very low cost. These products are engineered specifically for use in ducts or as ducts themselves, and are tested in accordance with standards established by Underwriters Laboratories (UL), the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), and the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA). Many insulated duct systems have operated for years without supporting significant mold growth. Keeping them reasonably clean and dry is generally adequate. However, there is substantial debate about whether porous insulation materials (e.g., fiber glass) are more prone to microbial contamination than bare sheet metal ducts. If enough dirt and moisture are permitted to enter the duct system, there may be no significant difference in the rate or extent of microbial growth in internally lined or bare sheet metal ducts. However, treatment of mold contamination on bare sheet metal is much easier. Cleaning and treatment with an EPA-registered biocide are possible. Once fiberglass duct liner is contaminated with mold, cleaning is not sufficient to prevent re-growth and there are no EPA-registered biocides for the treatment of porous duct materials. EPA, <a href="https://nadca.com/">NADCA</a> and <a href="http://insulationinstitute.org/">NAIMA</a> all recommend the replacement of wet or moldy fiber glass duct material.</p>

	<h3>In the meantime</h3>

	<p>Experts do agree that moisture should not be present in ducts and if moisture and dirt are present, the potential exists for biological contaminants to grow and be distributed throughout the home. Controlling moisture is the most effective way to prevent biological growth in all types of air ducts.</p>

		<p>Steam cleaning and other methods involving moisture should not be used on any kind of duct work.</p>
	</div>

	<h3>Should chemical biocides be applied to the inside of air ducts?</h3>

	<div class="box multi related-info right">
		<div class="pane-content">
			<p>No products are currently registered by EPA as biocides for use on fiberglass duct board or fiberglass lined ducts so it is important to determine if sections of your system contain these materials before permitting the application of any biocide.</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<p>Air duct cleaning service providers may tell you that they need to apply a chemical biocide to the inside of your ducts to kill bacteria (germs) and fungi (mold), and prevent future biological growth. Some duct cleaning service providers may propose to introduce ozone to kill biological contaminants. Ozone is a highly reactive gas that is regulated in the outside air as a lung irritant. However, there remains considerable controversy over the necessity and wisdom of introducing chemical biocides or ozone into the duct work.</p>

	<p>Among the possible problems with biocide and ozone application in air ducts:</p>

	<ul><li>Little research has been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of most biocides and ozone when used inside ducts. Simply spraying or otherwise introducing these materials into the operating duct system may cause much of the material to be transported through the system and released into other areas of your home.</li>
		<li>Some people may react negatively to the biocide or ozone, causing adverse health reactions.</li>
	</ul><p>Chemical biocides are regulated by EPA under Federal pesticide law. A product must be registered by EPA for a specific use before it can be legally used for that purpose. The specific use(s) must appear on the pesticide (e.g., biocide) label, along with other important information. It is a violation of federal law to use a pesticide product in any manner inconsistent with the label directions.</p>

	<p>A small number of products are currently registered by EPA specifically for use on the inside of bare sheet metal air ducts. A number of products are also registered for use as sanitizers on hard surfaces, which could include the interior of bare sheet metal ducts. While many such products may be used legally inside of unlined ducts if all label directions are followed, some of the directions on the label may be inappropriate for use in ducts. For example, if the directions indicate "rinse with water", the added moisture could stimulate mold growth.</p>

	<p>All of the products discussed above are registered solely for the purpose of sanitizing the smooth surfaces of unlined (bare) sheet metal ducts. No products are currently registered as biocides for use on fiber glass duct board or fiber glass lined ducts, so it is important to determine if sections of your system contain these materials before permitting the application of any biocide.</p>

	<h3>In the meantime</h3>

	<p>Before allowing a service provider to use a chemical biocide in your duct work, the service provider should:</p>

	<div>
		<div class="figure image left" style="width:15px"><img alt="checkmark" src="../sites/production/files/2014-07/checkmark.gif.html" style="width:15px" /></div>

		<p>Demonstrate visible evidence of microbial growth in your duct work. Some service providers may attempt to convince you that your air ducts are contaminated by demonstrating that the microorganisms found in your home grow on a settling plate (i.e., petri dish). This is inappropriate. Some microorganisms are always present in the air, and some growth on a settling plate is normal. As noted earlier, only an expert can positively identify a substance as biological growth and lab analysis may be required for final confirmation. Other testing methods are not reliable.</p>

		<div class="figure image left" style="width:15px"><img alt="checkmark" src="../sites/production/files/2014-07/checkmark.gif.html" style="width:15px" /></div>

		<p>Show you the biocide label, which will describe its range of approved uses.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="clear-left">
		<div class="figure image left" style="width:15px"><img alt="checkmark" src="../sites/production/files/2014-07/checkmark.gif.html" style="width:15px" /></div>

		<p>Apply the biocide only to un-insulated areas of the duct system after proper cleaning, if necessary to reduce the chances for re-growth of mold.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="clear-left">
		<div class="figure image left" style="width:15px"><img alt="checkmark" src="../sites/production/files/2014-07/checkmark.gif.html" style="width:15px" /></div>

		<p>Always use the product strictly according to its label instructions.</p>
	</div>

	<p>While some low toxicity products may be legally applied while occupants of the home are present, you may wish to consider leaving the premises while the biocide is being applied as an added precaution.</p>

	<h3>Do sealants prevent the release of dust and dirt particles into the air?</h3>

	<p>Manufacturers of products marketed to coat and encapsulate duct surfaces claim that these sealants prevent dust and dirt particles inside air ducts from being released into the air. As with biocides, a sealant is often applied by spraying it into the operating duct system. Laboratory tests indicate that materials introduced in this manner tend not to completely coat the duct surface. Application of sealants may also affect the acoustical (noise) and fire retarding characteristics of fiber glass lined or constructed ducts and may invalidate the manufacturer's warranty.</p>

	<p>Questions about the safety, effectiveness and overall desirability of sealants remain. For example, little is known about the potential toxicity of these products under typical use conditions or in the event they catch fire.</p>

	<p>In addition, sealants have yet to be evaluated for their resistance to deterioration over time which could add particles to the duct air.</p>

	<h3>In the meantime</h3>

	<p>Most organizations concerned with duct cleaning, including EPA, <a href="https://nadca.com/">NADCA</a>, <a href="http://insulationinstitute.org/">NAIMA</a> and the Sheet Metal and Air Conditioning Contractors' National Association (SMACNA) do not currently recommend the routine use of sealants to encapsulate contaminants in any type of duct. Instances when the use of sealants to encapsulate the duct surfaces may be appropriate include the repair of damaged fiber glass insulation or when combating fire damage within ducts. Sealants should never be used on wet duct liner, to cover actively growing mold, or to cover debris in the ducts, and should only be applied after cleaning according to <a href="https://nadca.com/">NADCA</a> or other appropriate guidelines or standards.</p>
