<h2 id="regional">Regional Healthy Watersheds Programs</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.chesapeakebay.net/groups/group/maintaining_healthy_watersheds_goal_implementation_team">Maintaining Healthy Watersheds in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed</a>Â The 2014 Chesapeake Watershed Agreement contains a new Healthy Watersheds Goal: sustain state-identified healthy waters and watersheds recognized for their high quality and/or high ecological value with an outcome of 100 percent of state-identified currently healthy waters and watersheds remaining healthy. The Chesapeake Bay Program Maintain Healthy Watersheds Goal Implementation Team implements strategies to achieve this goal. The Team is developing methods to track watershed health and protection status. Tracking measures are reported on the <a href="http://stat.chesapeakebay.net/?q=node/131&amp;quicktabs_21=0">Chesapeake Stat</a>Â website.</p>

<h3 id="state">State Healthy Watersheds Programs</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.mywaterquality.ca.gov/monitoring_council/healthy_streams/">California Healthy Streams Partnership</a>Â The Healthy Streams Partnership (HSP) is an interagency workgroup of the California Water Quality Monitoring Council. The mission of the HSP is to promote the protection of Californiaâs healthy streams and the restoration of threatened and impaired streams by providing timely and accurate information directly useful for resource management decisions and actions. The HSP participated in the development of the EPA Healthy Watersheds Program funded <a href="http://water.epa.gov/water404.cfm">California Integrated Assessment of Watershed Health</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/whaf/index.html">Minnesota Watershed Health Assessment Framework</a>Â Minnesotaâs Department of Natural Resources has embraced an integrated approach to watershed protection and restoration, recognizing that âthe health of a watershed is enhanced when the five components - hydrology, connectivity, geomorphology, biology, and water quality - have a functional relationship within that ecosystem. Interactions occur at all scales of time and place, and the pieces come together into a synergistic whole.â Through the Watershed Health Assessment Framework, Minnesota has generated extensive information on the health of its watersheds and will perform periodic updates to track protection progress and emerging health trends.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.tn.gov/environment/water/water_tn-healthy-watershed-initiative.shtml">Tennessee Healthy Watershed Initiative</a>Â The Tennessee Healthy Watershed Initiative (THWI) is a collaboration of federal, state and nonprofit organizations committed to maintain and improve water resources in Tennessee watersheds. The THWI: 1) Provides a forum for communication, collaboration and thoughtful planning among a broad partnership of agencies and interests; 2) Coordinates implementation of protection and improvement efforts to protect and improve Tennesseeâs waters; and 3) Ensures that Tennessee has healthy watersheds that are resilient, able to adapt to changing future conditions, and provide adequate and reliable water supplies for healthy communities, strong economies and interconnections between rivers and their users.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dcr.virginia.gov/soil_and_water/healthy_waters/">Virginia Healthy Waters Initiative</a>Â Virginia's Healthy Waters initiative is an effort to maintain ecological balance and broaden conservation efforts to include critical healthy natural resources before they are compromised.

<p><a href="http://www.defenders.org/resources/publications/programs_and_policy/biodiversity_partners/conservation_in_america_state_profiles.pdf">Conservation in America: State Government Incentives for Habitat Conservation (PDF)</a> <span class="fileinfo">(108 pp, 264 K) </span>The Defenders of Wildlife produced this report to document state-level incentive programs for aquatic and terrestrial habitat conservation. Programs relevant to aquatic ecosystem protection take the form of cost-shares, tax benefits, easement purchases and land acquisitions to protect wetlands, riparian forests and other lands from degradation. Program summaries are provided for each state and contact information is made available.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/eco/streamhab/index.html">Minnesota Stream Habitat Program</a>Â The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources Stream Habitat Program gathers and provides information on Minnesota streams and rivers to guide protection and restoration efforts. The Stream Habitat Program frames stream health around five components: shape, flow, connectivity, biology and water quality. A primary objective is to ensure that an adequate amount of water is flowing in rivers and streams throughout the year to protect fish and wildlife. The Stream Habitat Program also works to promote stream connectivity through dam removals, installation of fish passages and design of road-stream crossings to minimize stream impacts.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.defenders.org/resources/publications/programs_and_policy/biodiversity_partners/oregon_stewardship_incentives.pdf">Stewardship Incentives: Conservation Strategies for Oregonâs Working Landscape</a>Â As part of the Oregon Biodiversity Project, the Stewardship Incentives report evaluates options for improving stewardship to protect biodiversity, habitats and the ecological services provided by natural landscapes.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.lvwash.org/html/">Habitat Protection for the Las Vegas Wash</a>Â Nevadaâs Las Vegas Wash Coordination Committee was developed to restore and enhance riparian areas and the ecological resources within the Las Vegas Wash.</p>

<p><a href="https://fortress.wa.gov/ecy/publications/publications/1106016.pdf">Puget Sound Characterization: The Water Resource Assessments (Water Flow and Water Quality) (PDF)</a> <span class="fileinfo">(74 pp, 6.4MB) </span>The Puget Sound Characterization is a set of water and habitat assessments that compare areas within a watershed for restoration and protection value. It is a coarse-scale decision-support tool that provides information for regional, county and watershed-based planning. The assessments cover water resources (both water flow and water quality) and fish and wildlife habitats (in terrestrial, freshwater and marine nearshore areas) over the entire drainage area of Puget Sound. The assessments provide a watershed-scale perspective on the relative importance of small watersheds for the protection and restoration of water resources and habitats that is not generally provided by other available tools. Final results can also be analyzed to identify the basis for a small watershedâs relative importance, and to guide potential management strategies for that watershed. The information it provides will allow local and regional governments and others to base their decisions regarding land use on a systematic analytic framework that prioritizes specific geographic areas on the landscape as focus areas for protection, restoration and conservation of the regionâs natural resources, and that also identifies areas that are likely more suitable for development.</p>
